A UK Foreign and Commonwealth Office spokesman told Lloyd's List: ``We do not export equip ment where there is a clear risk it might be used for internal repression or where it might be diverted to a different end - use or user.'' The UK considers all export licences individually against these criteria, to reflect the prevailing circumstances and s tated end - use, both for armouries operated on water and for those on land."
