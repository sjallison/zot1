These can be analyzed in terms of a simple typology.One key distinction is analytic: contrasting the Prisoners' Dilemma structure of traditional Pigovian externalities with the Coordination structure of network externalities. The second distinction is substantive: contrasting physical or technological externalities with externalities that arise in the creation of public policy. The four resulting circumstances are typically addressed by alternative governance arrangements: varying combinations of private and public governance – according to the respective interests and competencies of the two spheres – and varying levels of governance – national, regional or global – according to the scope of the problem and the capacity of institutions. Our analysis of these choices is primarily positive, but the comparative institutional framework we develop is equally useful for addressing the associated normative question – how should international standards be set?},

As neither state has made an express public claim of historic title to the waters, any evidence for such a claim must be sought in less explicit and sometimes conflicting sources. This article applies the United States' legal test for a historic waters claim, recently set out in the U.S. Department of State's analysis of China's claims in the South China Sea, and concludes that the boundary waters of the Salish Sea would not meet that test. Accordingly, the waters of the Salish Sea boundary straits on the United States' side of the international boundary must be considered a territorial sea.},

Whilst piracy has always been a perennial problem in the region, this threat has received increasing attention over the past few years. Reports published by the International Maritime Organization as well as the International Maritime Bureau show an alarming increase in acts of piracy on Southeast Asian waters over the past decade. In ancient times, the main drivers of piracy were raiding for plunder and capture of slaves; however, in modern times, developments in politics, economics and even military technology have drastically altered the universal crime of piracy. There are a variety of motives behind modern day piracy including economic gains from receiving ransoms from governments or shipping companies, political and even terrorist reasons. However, it cannot be denied that piratical attacks persist and continue. Efforts are being taken by States at the international as well as regional level to combat piracy. At the international level, piracy is addressed in several legal frameworks. The primary legal framework is contained in the 1982 United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, which allows Member States to address piracy in their national legislation. At the regional level, measures taken in order to fight piracy include the adoption of the ASEAN Declaration on the Prevention and Control of Transnational Crime , which includes piracy as a transnational crime. This paper will examine the adequacy of legal frameworks at both the international and regional levels in order to address the current legal measures for combating piracy. Furthermore, it will discuss current challenges in the implementation of anti-piracy measures at the international and regional levels.},

This article is the first to study the effects of the process of publicization, a term coined to characterize the transformation of private into public standards. The central hypothesis studied is that the process of publicization has empowerment and containment effects at the same time. To test the hypothesis the article analyses the effects of publicization on regulatory capabilities of private regulators as well as on the quality of the standards. The effects of publicization are further explored by comparing the legal and institutional architecture that shapes the coexistence of private and public regimes in the EU and the US, showing important differences between the two systems. The article offers a new perspective to look at the dynamic interaction between private and public regulation and its findings are of general relevance for the debate on the desirability of governmental intervention on private regulatory schemes.},

As a captain in the Royal Navy, I was in charge of an anti-piracy task group - and I saw the same excitability and lack of rationality that we see in the characters in this film. They're often caught between a rock and a hard place: just like in the movie, their bosses may well have told them not to bother coming back alive unless it's with a valuable ransom. I remember the incident this film is based on: the hijacking of the Maersk Alabama, an American cargo ship, in 2009. The US Navy took charge of freeing the hostages, but we were all watching closely. The director, Paul Greengrass, has no doubt taken a degree of artistic licence with the story, but it feels like a fair representation. I think it should be required viewing for anyone involved in combatting Somali piracy.},

@article{Bennett_2000,
  abstract = {In this paper I investigate an institution which combines two forms of risk regulation commonly regarded as antithetical. In the governmental mode, associated with the rise of capitalism, the welfare state, and commercial insurance, regulation is centralised and spatially removed from the risk itself, and involves the surveillance, prediction, and control of risks posed by large-scale populations of atomised individuals or companies. This is in contrast to the older mutual form, in which social relations within communities allocate and minimise risks, evident in the moral economy of the peasantry, friendly societies, and the resurgence of discourses of community responsibility in the 1990s. Protection and Indemnity (P\&I) Clubs are mutual associations of the world's shipowners, which insure marine liabilities (including environmental risks). Their communal structure and self-interest in minimising risks means that they could, and to an extent do, play an important role in regulating marine safety and environmental performance. However, their global scale means that social relations between shipowners are not simply analogous to those within a local community. The P\&I Clubs do, in practice, employ centralised managers responsible for determining entry standards, setting premiums, handling claims, and engaging in loss prevention. These activities rest upon the ‘scientific’ calculation, allocation, and management of risks. At the same time the aim is to ‘maintain mutuality’ amongst members, and tacit knowledge and actively produced trust are essential to this end. I argue that the combination of a mutual structure and a global scale produces a hybrid style of regulation, and the successful application of rules, incentives, sanctions, and surveillance depends as much on the construction of specific sociospatial relations as on organisational form, with implications for new regulatory designs.},

I disagree with Ulrich Beck that we now live in a distinct ‘risk society’ which renders science, government and business impotent in managing risk. However, I argue that centralized state regulation (and its corollary in commercial insurance) discourages relationships of mutual responsibility between private actors, exacerbating any so-called ‘tragedy of the commons’. This limits the effectiveness of both public regulation and private incentives, such as liability, in altering corporate behaviour. I then examine institutional arrangements which encourage mutual regulation between private actors. Governments are increasingly attempting to enrol this ‘moral economy’, which exists within business groups such as mutual insurance clubs. Although reinforcing some limitations of traditional governmentality these co-operative arrangements may enhance corporate environmental performance.},

The focus is on Protection and Indemnity (P\&amp;I) Clubs in which third-party liabilities of 90\% of the world's fleet (by tonnage) are insured. In theory, this creates a mutual interest amongst shipowners in minimising risk. The paper examines how this mutual interest is translated into individual behaviour, and the institutional challenges involved in maintaining mutuality within and between the Clubs. There follows an evaluation of the legitimacy of enrolling private interest groups in regulation in which a wide range of actors hold a stake. The paper concludes that P\&amp;I Clubs make a modest contribution to safety and environmental regulation, but also have some potentially unfavourable wider social implications.},

Its basic purpose is to balance and adjust conflicting interests — public and private, e.g., claims to territory, to the exploitation of oil and mineral rights, to freedom of navigation, to fishing rights and so on. The present U.N. Law of the Sea Conference is an attempt to regulate these conflicting claims on the international level in a comprehensive way. But were the Conference to fail, wholly or partially, there would not be a legal vacuum either in international or in national law, as an examination of English law (including the English rules of international law) in respect of the continental shelf and the deep ocean demonstrates. Such an examination also demonstrates how one system of national law seeks to balance the interests of the state in respect of offshore activities (e.g., to participate in, control and obtain revenue from offshore operations) as against the interests of individuals (e.g., to obtain a commercial return on, and security for, the money and human effort they invest in offshore activities).},

@article{benvenistiGlobalChecksBalances2009,
  abstract = {The rapid growth and importance of intergovernmental coordination in the regulation of markets, transportation and communication, the environment, and national security poses numerous challenges for democratic accountability within participating states. Direct public participation in the intergovernmental regulatory bodies is generally modest or absent. Information regarding their deliberations is limited. And the multiple oversight mechanisms and supervisory processes that exist at the domestic level of developed democracies that can scrutinize intergovernmental regulatory decisions tend to be lacking. This lack of accountability raises legitimacy concerns, the most prominent of which is the fear executive branch officials will delegate controversial policy decisions to intergovernmental bodies in order to escape democratic deliberation. In this paper we survey the ways that different review venues (other international institutions and national courts) are attempting to cope with these accountability related issues: we argue that national courts may prove to be the most effective venue for promoting democratic accountability. This is not because they are more reliably representative of their domestic constituency or possess a more cosmopolitan perspective than the bodies whose decisions they are reviewing. Rather their relative advantage lies in: 1. the increasing acceptance on the part of domestic courts that inter-judicial coordination is a prerequisite for their continued ability to fulfill their judicial review function and 2. the visibility that the decisions of these courts possess. Acting together these two forces have the potential to foster greater transparency and public deliberation than most rival venues. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

  abstract = {The last time I was in Somalia, I marvelled at the sight of three cargo ships sailing with brazen confidence along the Indian Ocean coast near Mogadishu. Were they not risking capture by pirates? Well, the latest figures confirm that Somalia’s pirates are in retreat. According to the International Maritime Bureau, the number of attacks has fallen by two thirds since last year. There was only one attempted hijacking in the third quarter of 2012. In the first nine months of this year, 70 incidents of piracy took place, compared with 199 in the same period of 2011. Why has this happened? Partly because of a big naval deployment off Somalia’s coast. A small armada of warships from countries across the world now operates in the Indian Ocean and the Gulf of Aden. In addition, normal merchant ships now bristle with private security guards, making them far more able to look after themselves. All this has made piracy a far riskier business.},

@report{block-liebContractsPrivateLaw2014,
  abstract = {The creation of global markets rarely proceeds without the creation of institutions to enable and set parameters around global market actors, whether multinational companies, seafaring carriers, international banks or other private global investors. And yet little is known about the institutional matrix of lawmaking organizations on which markets depend. What is known about the proliferation of international institutions to rationalize the legal framework for global trade has prompted socio-legal scholars to question whether this accumulation of organizations creates legal fragmentation (Koskenniemi 2002), complexity (Alter; Kennedy), harmonization or subversion (Schaffer and Pollack 2010; Mallard 2014), the institutionalization of transnational legal orders (Halliday \& Shaffer 2015a; Block-Lieb \& Halliday 2015), or contestations among their proponents (Halliday \& Shaffer 2015b).   This paper provides the long view of a complex of international lawmaking organizations that emerged over 150 years, ultimately to constitute an ecology of international trade lawmaking. Among other goals and practices of these organizations, the formation and evolution of this ecology turned substantially on negotiations and disputes among lawmaking IOs about which of them had the authority to formulate international instruments governing private parties’ contractual practices, a broad terrain of law that is characterized most commonly as international private law (e.g., laws governing private contracts and the relationships between private actors as opposed to laws governing the interactions or agreements between states).   More particularly, we examine the emergence of three principal organizations over more than a century - the Hague Conference on Private International Law, the International Institute for the Unification of Private Law (first known as the Rome Institute and later renamed UNIDROIT) and the UN Commission on International Trade Law (UNCITRAL) - in order to advance an ecological theory of international organizations (Block-Lieb and Halliday 2011a and b; Abbott et al. In Press). Such a theory would explain the emergence of these organizations and the lawmaking ecology in the geopolitical and economic contexts and conditions of their respective foundings. It would identify how each IO demarcated its boundaries vis-à-vis other IOs and claimed niches to ensure resources sufficient minimally for survival and optimally for competitive advantage.   By employing ecological theory in the analysis of institutional complexification, we shift the central focus of socio-legal analyses of global legal complexity from an emphasis on textual interpretations of rules (Koskenniemi 2002; Schaffer and Pollack 2010; Mallard 2014) to a focus on assertions of competence, claims of legitimacy, and other boundary-marking practices leading to more or less settlement of relations among potentially competitive international trade lawmaking bodies. Hence we will pay less attention to the substantive law created by the Hague Conference, UNIDROIT and UNCITRAL for the governance of global trade and more to their claims to authority over a specific territory in the terrains of contractual law.  Building upon studies of professional conflicts and settlements in an ecological setting (Abbott 1988:69), we distinguish among different ways in which IOs have managed territorial conflicts so that their constellation formed a moving equilibrium which itself was constrained, enabled, and propelled by historical events. These settlements variously involved: full authority, when an IO successfully asserted its exclusivity over an issue area; subordination, when various IOs recognized each but understand their relationships hierarchically; division of labor, when IOs chose cooperation over direct competition in an horizontal playing field that involved the differentiation of tasks; and market segmentation, when IOs cooperate to divide the global terrain according to issue areas of particular salience.    There are two innovations we offer in this theoretical orientation. On the one hand, ecology theory has rarely been applied to the social space of international organizations (although cf. Abbott et al In Press). On the other hand, ecology theory in general has attended relatively less to the emergence of ecologies than the dynamics of already functioning ecologies.   We advance this conjunction of ecological explanations with the institutionalization of meta-law governing contractual practices in four steps. First, we step back into the nineteenth century to sketch the origins of an impetus toward the unification of private and other international law standards, not least with the conferences convened as the Hague Conference on Private International Law. Second, we observe in some detail the emergence of an entity, the Rome Institute, later renamed as UNIDROIT, as a product of the League of Nations between World War I and II. Third, we demonstrate that a seeming settlement among international lawmaking IOs was disturbed by the founding of new IOs in the economic and geopolitical turbulence of the 1960s, most notably with the contested founded of UNCITRAL in 1964. Fourth, we demonstrate that after three decades of lawmaking co-existence through the fall of the Soviet command economies and the subsequent debt crises of the 1990s, the lawmaking ecology was again unsettled as its most prominent actors sought to reconstitute themselves, and their relations with each other, in a new geopolitical and economic world order. The paper concludes with a retrospective long view of the ways ecological processes shaped both the institutional and substantive parameters of contracting in increasingly globalized markets.},

@report{bowlingGlobalPolicingTransnational2015,
  abstract = {This paper explores the connection between transnational law and policing. Following a brief overview of the global policing field and its relationship with law, we use socio-legal theories of policing to examine four examples of law in action: (i) the global money system, (ii) transnational mobility, (iii) intellectual property and (iv) high policing. These examples illustrate how legal instruments become tools in the hands of public and private social actors operating in the transnational sphere. The paper advances three arguments. First, we argue that global policing practices exemplify rule with law not rule of law. That is, technocratic ‘legal engineers’ use legal ‘power tools’ to achieve specific ends that usually uphold the existing global system dominated by seigneurial states and powerful private corporations. Examining transnational law in action illustrates that the global order is a rule with law system. Second, we argue that attempts to codify transnational (criminal) law and procedure must recognise the distinction between ‘law in the books’ and the ‘living law’ revealed in the practice of transnational policing. Rather than constraining power, law is better understood as a tool available to police that enables intrusive surveillance and coercion (among other things). Third, we argue that the study of transnational policing should not be restricted to the response to transnational organised crime or defined as coterminous with transnational criminal law. Global policing practices deploy many kinds of public and private law as power tools in the governance of the global system.},

With his 9/11 nightmare United 93 (2006) and his Northern Ireland drama Bloody Sunday (2002), I came down with these same symptoms: shallow breathing, heart arrhythmia, a high-pitched keening coming from somewhere behind clenched teeth and a tendency to grab the red plush of the seat in front.

@report{cafaggiManyFeaturesTransnational2015,
  abstract = {Every-day life of businesses and consumers is pervaded by the references to global private standards: from the cars we drive to the computers we use, from the food we eat to the movies we watch. Private rule-making at the transnational level is increasingly gaining scope and traction, quickly expanding in both old and new territories. This is partly the result of weaknesses in conventional international public law and partly the result of the emergence of new modes of governance. Stimulated by the actions of states and private actors, these new modes of governance include public, private, and hybrid instruments.Private actors engage in transnational rulemaking in different forms depending on their objectives, the geographical and functional scope, and the effects of the regimes on the entities being regulated. The fields of application go well beyond those traditionally occupied by ‘jura mercatorum,’ including agriculture, human rights, social and labor regulation, environment, and the more conventional areas, such as finance, banking, professions, and trade, including e-commerce.These private regimes are sector specific but not self-contained. They presuppose the existence of international and domestic institutions that can support their functioning. They interact by both giving rise to conflicts or by mutually reinforcing one another. The premise of the analysis that follows is that of institutional complementarity rather than that of separate and autonomous private orderings. The conceptual puzzle concerns the definition of different types of complementarity between private and public actors. Is the expansion of transnational private rule making simply an evolution of more conventional forms of custom and jus mercatorum or does it depart from these forms of private rule-making? In the latter case is there a common denominator of current forms of transnational private rule-making? How does private rule making correlate with international and domestic public legal orders? Do they constitute separate private orderings? Do they complement, supplement or replace public legal orders? What is the combination between legal and non-legal norms? Not only these questions have theoretical relevance but they also shape important regulatory policy choices at the international level concerning legitimacy, compliance and enforcement of global private standards? Transnational private regulatory regimes – it is contended – do not represent an alternative to jus mercatorum since their functional focus is regulation driven by market failures rather than a set of prescriptions related to individual transactions between market participants. They integrate current public market regulation or contribute to the creation of new markets through market design. The multifarious forms of transnational private rule-making pose daunting questions concerning their origins, functions and scope. This article addresses the different forms of transnational private rule-making; it tries to examine their differences and the consequences for their normative foundations and policy objectives. After a brief historical overview, section I analyses transnational private regulation (TPR), and section II examines usages, customs and jura mercatorum. Section III presents a comparative assessment between TPR and custom. Section IV defines an agenda for future research and it is followed by the conclusion.},

In section II, the focus is on the private sphere, looking at both the different conflicts of interests arising in the regulatory relationships and the need for governance responses. In section III, institutional complementarity between public and private regimes is examined. In light of this approach, the claim that differences between public and private at the global level exist is substantiated. The public-private divide is analysed, comparing the domestic and the transnational level. Four different models of interaction are identified: hybridization, collaborative law-making, coordination, and competition. Section IV summarizes the results of the analysis, reconsidering the boundaries between public and private at transnational level.},

  abstract = {The paper investigates the relation between private transnational regulation through standards and the formation of transnational networks. More particularly, focusing on standards compliance, the analysis is intended to test whether private regulation induces the existence of networks able to: (a) enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of compliance coordination in accordance with a “whole-chain supply approach” to safety regulation; (b) contribute to monitoring along the chain, even when this function is in different ways performed by other players (public authorities, independent certifiers, etc.); (c) possibly and eventually redistribute costs of compliance along the chain. Starting from the observation of contractual practices, mainly within supply chains subject to international certification schemes (for example in the case of food supply chains), different models of networks will be compared depending on: (i) the allocation of monitoring and sanctioning powers (these being assigned to producers, traders or independent actors); (ii) the means of monitoring (peer monitoring v. more formalised monitoring duties); (iii) the types of sanctions (particularly, label/certificate suspension or revocation); (iv) the structure of the network (as based on merely linked contracts or on a mix of contractual and organizational relations).},

  abstract = {Lex mercatoria or Law Merchant (‘LM’) is said to be the self-made law of international commerce. According to its proponents, LM is an autonomous legal order that not only supplements state commercial law, but works as a substitute for it. The ‘ancient’ LM, which accompanied the commercial revolution in late medieval Europe, is taken as a blueprint for ‘new’ LM, a transnational law that develops in international commercial arbitration to govern modern global commerce. According to its opponents, ancient LM as a uniform customary law of Europe never existed. Rather it was dreamed-up in order to support the neo-liberal agenda of new LM.This paper investigates the historical and empirical foundations of these claims in the three dimensions of transnational dispute resolution, norm making, and enforcement. It is concluded that truly autonomous transnational legal regimes are industry-specific exceptions, where socio-economic sanctions are formally organized. Transnational commercial law in general is characterised by a hybrid mode of governance, which combines institutions of private (norms, arbitration, and social sanctions) and public (laws, courts, and enforcement) origin. However, the latter are disembedded from their domestic context to a considerable extent.},

High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy co-chaired a forum on piracy in the margins of the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting in Perth, attended by Indian Ocean Rim countries and stakeholders promoting security in Somalia and off the Horn of Africa.
The Australian Government at that time agreed to host a Counter-Piracy Conference in Perth this year designed to explore further options to reduce piracy in Somalia and beyond. This Conference was held on 16–17 July 2012.
It was attended by delegates from
59 countries and organisations and chaired by Mr Peter Jennings, Executive Director of the Australian Strategic Policy Institute.
The Conference addressed global issues
with piracy and armed robbery against
ships. It compared the situation in the three main areas where these crimes are most prolific—in Southeast Asia, off the coast of Somalia and in the Gulf of Guinea—with a view towards gaining ideas about the lessons to be learned and how the fight against piracy and sea robbery might be strengthened at the national, regional and international levels.
This Special Report opens with the speech presented by Warren Snowdon, Minister
for Defence Science and Personnel, on behalf of Stephen Smith, Australian Minister for Defence to the Perth Counter-Piracy Conference.
The report sets out a background paper prepared for the Conference by Dr Sam Bateman, Maritime Security Programme,
S. Rajaratnam School of International Studies, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore, who was assisted in this task by ASPI’s Deputy Director, Dr Anthony Bergin.
The report concludes with some personal reflections on the Perth international meeting by the Chairman of the Counter-Piracy Conference, as well as the final Chairman’s Statement, issued immediately following the conclusion of the Conference.

@article{casiniRabbitholeProjectionPublic2014,
  abstract = {This article deals with two of the greatest “dualisms” present in contemporary legal systems: the distinction between international law and domestic law on the one hand, and the distinction between public law and private law, on the other. The evolution of these two great dualisms is linked to the emergence of global public interests, the strategic role played by states and domestic administrations in the global arena, and the need to control and review how global hybrid institutions exercise their increasing powers. This contributes significantly to the emergence of multipolar administrative law, in which both public and private traits, and both domestic and international dimensions, constantly interact. Beyond the state, public and private law finds new ways of combining, borrowing tools and imitating solutions. In particular, when the public/private distinction goes international, it operates as a technology of global governance: it is a “proxy” for bringing given values into a new legal context and for recreating a “familiar” legal endeavor beyond the state.

The focus was on preventing human rights violations, preventing companies from operating who have not put in place the necessary measures to prevent human rights violations, and on developing new forms of accountability. There are rules deriving from international humanitarian law, international human rights law, state responsibility, and other sources applicable to private military and security companies (PMSC) operations. The regulation of a new phenomenon such as the use of PMSCs on an international level is a challenge. Clear rules are needed rapidly to establish predictability, accountability and legitimacy. But the traditional instruments of international law, such as international conventions, take quite some time to be negotiated and ratified by a sufficient number of states. New approaches and methods are therefore needed to set new international rules and standards.},

The interaction of these two factors goes a long way towards explaining the ways in which legal norms, actors, and institutions have been enrolled to construct and organize powerful actors in the global economy. In order to explore these dynamics, the article focuses on the area of private international law and analyzes the ongoing effort to harmonize the legal rules governing secured credit. This case study helps to highlight the connections between legal expertise and projects of political economic power, and to work out a fundamental dynamic generated by legal pluralism – the combination of continued conflicts between powerful actors in a context of shared understandings of the basic rules of the global economic system. I conclude by considering the obstacles presented by these dynamics for projects that aim at harnessing international economic law to the needs and interests of the weak.},

  abstract = {Is it important to conceptualize transnational law and “map” it as a new legal field? This article suggests that to do so might help both juristic practice and sociolegal scholarship in organizing, linking, and comparing disparate but increasingly significant types of regulation. To explore the idea of transnational law is to raise basic questions about the nature of both “law” and “society” (taken as the realm law regulates). This involves radically rethinking relationships between the public and the private, between law and state, and between different sources of law and legal authority. Taking as its focus Von Daniels's The Concept of Law from a Transnational Perspective and Calliess and Zumbansen's Rough Consensus and Running Code (both 2010), the article considers what approaches may be most productive, and what key issues need to be addressed, to make sense of broad trends in law's extension beyond the boundaries of nation-states.},

The volume seeks to cover the entirety of the field of international responsibility, with a particular focus on the work of the International Law Commission. It provides detailed discussion and analysis of the historically predominant topics of State responsibility, on which the ILC completed its work in 2001, and the specific sub-topic of diplomatic protection, work on which was completed by the ILC in 2006. However, it also covers both the topic of responsibility of international organizations, on which the ILC's work is ongoing (a set of draft Articles having been adopted on first reading in 2009), and that of liability for harmful activities not prohibited under international law on which the ILC adopted drafts in 2001 and 2006.The volume comprises contributions on specific issues in the international law of responsibility, authored by an international team of specialists in the field, which provides a comprehensive commentary of all aspects of the topic. The chapters are detailed in their coverage, discussing both international jurisprudence and doctrinal controversies, as well as providing a critical assessment of the relevant work of the ILC. In addition to providing detailed consideration of the general secondary rules of international responsibility, coverage is also included of certain specific systems of responsibility and their relationship with the general rules under a number of specialised regimes, in particular under certain human rights treaties, the WTO, and investment protection treaties.},

  abstract = {There exists a range of situations where non-state actors and states can possibly share responsibility for their contribution to harmful outcomes, thereby raising a multitude of questions on the determination, content and implementation of responsibility in such a scenario. It may be tempting to adopt an approach whereby a shared responsibility regime involving non-state actors and states draws ex post on the regime put in place by the ILC Articles on Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts, especially in connection to the rules of attribution of conduct and attribution of responsibility. Such a model of international responsibility, however, would only work to the extent that addressees are bound by primary norms of international law in the first place. This is certainly not a given in respect of non-state actors. Moreover, non-state actors may differ fundamentally from states, thereby making the transposition of traditional rules of state responsibility artificial and inadequate: their loosely organised, temporary, diverse, illegitimate, or even outright criminal character may militate against applying the classic responsibility paradigm to non-state-state interactions. In view of these limitations, a turn to an ex ante approach to questions of shared responsibility, through standard-setting, has been suggested, and may be cautiously supported in respect of the activities of a number of non-state actors. This, however, is not exclusive to the simultaneous application of ex post and ex ante approaches to shared responsibility.},

We will address each of these questions separately, complementing each time a general analysis with empirical examples drawn from the field of lex sportiva. In our view, there is a pressing need for empirical work and pragmatic description of legal phenomena reaching beyond the state.

Those evaluations make an impact on states' modernization; they change the paradigms, values, stereotypes, programming transformation and reforms. Other evaluations do not have any significant influence and are likely put on the e-shelves of the governments and universities computers. Evaluation researches are defined as reformistic, which aim to develop an alternatives for the social improvement. One of the functions of evaluation is an improvement by assessing policy output and outcome. Most outcomes are jointly determined and controlled by plurality of the actors. Evaluation helps to change a policy agenda, policy formulation and implementation strategies. Modern scientific and technological achievements provide governments with real and noticeable military, economic, political, diplomatic power. Under such circumstances, a critical question emerge: is the influence of policy evaluations determined by the qualifications of the evaluators, the political-economic situation or the efforts of the international donors community to export values, knowledge, ideas which have either direct or indirect interest to the development efforts?

In this introduction, we propose an analytical framework for the study of transnational business governance interactions. The framework disaggregates the regulatory process to identify potential points of interaction, and suggests analytical questions that probe the key features of interactions at each point.},

This paper addresses the lack of legal concepts reflecting the systemic nature of GVCs as a key challenge for their regulation. Innovative governance alternatives originate bottom-up in civil society, rather than through legislation. In particular, third-party certification may be an instrument that matches GVCs as regulatory subjects and embodies a tailored concept of responsibility. While the current proliferation of such schemes and their diverging degree of rigidity has raised concerns, certification represents an indispensable building-block of transnational regulation. Transnational law must carefully trace the regulatory logic and flank the emergence of such social institutions reflexively. Only then can the scholarly endeavour of ‘transnational law’ rise to the challenge of projecting and rearranging guarantees of political autonomy beyond the state.},

@article{enaChoiceLawPredictability2007,
  abstract = {This Comment explores the complicated choice of law questions arising in products liability cases where the product in question is often produced in one state, sold in another, and caused an injury in a third. Which state's law will be used is often a highly contested issue among the interested parties to such a suit. Because of the lack of uniformity in the choice of law methodologies and the differences in rules of law among the states, decisions are often inconsistent and highly unpredictable. Predictability of law is especially important in the products liability context for identification of business risks in the marketing of particular products. This Comment analyzes two of the most prevailing choice of law methodologies: lex loci delicti and the "most significant relationship" rule of the Second Restatement of Conflict of Laws. It focuses on recent decisions coming out of New Jersey and Indiana and reveals how these decisions add to the inconsistency and unpredictability of products liability choice of law court decisions. The Comment argues that neither the First nor the Second Restatement approaches are entirely adequate to provide guidance to courts or to manufacturers of mass-marketed goods. It concludes that an approach that combines enhancements to the Second Restatement with federal preemption for certain types of products that are already heavily regulated by the federal government may be a more realistic answer to the question of consistency and predictability of court decisions in products liability cases.},

According to the World Shipping Council, in 2011 there were 439 pirate attacks and 45 merchant vessels hijacked worldwide; 237 of these attacks and 28 of these hijackings occurred in the Gulf of Aden, off the coast of Somalia, and in the wider Indian Ocean. So the latest Danish drama from Tobias Lindholm — the man behind Borgen and The Hunt — is right on the money. It tells the story of the cargo ship MV Rozen, which is heading for harbour when it's boarded by Somali pirates; Pilou Asbæk (Borgen's Kasper Juul) is the ship's cook; Søren Malling (Sarah Lund's sidekick, Jan Meyer, in The Killing) is the CEO of the shipping company — who chooses to negotiate with the hijackers himself. A Hijacking took the Best Nordic Film Award at the Gothenburg Film Festival earlier this year, and was a standout at last year's Venice Film Festival. Even if you're not as obsessed with Danish drama as we are, this is one to catch.},

Meanwhile, a Somali fisherman called Muse (Barkhad Abdi) is part of a community terrorised by a local warlord. They have no choice but to obey when this baron orders them out on a hijack expedition tooled up with semi-automatic assault rifles.

While warships at sea within the current legal framework of UNCLOS and the UN Security Council amplifications specifically adopted for the case of Somalia can effectively perform their tasks, the question of what to do with the pirate suspects is still not satisfactorily resolved. As a consequence, attacks against merchant vessels and international trade run the risk of being ‘consequence free’, in which the perpetrators are not being held accountable. Participating nations are confronted with the fact that military operations against piracy, which is essentially a criminal offence, need a comprehensive approach to ensure accountability. To counter this criminal activity at sea nations try to strengthen the judicial infrastructure through national prosecution or transfer suspects for prosecution in the Horn of Africa region. As these options are not considered to be enough, and hampered by other non-legal factors, some nations call for an international court as a possible long term solution.},

  abstract = {The growing practice of environmental supply chain management by firms constitutes private sector regulation that is analogous in many ways to public sector regulation. Similarly to their public counterparts, private sector regulators set standards, apply standards, monitor for compliance, apply sanctions and require corrective action. Private sector regulation differs, however, in the source of authority, external oversight, analytical requirements, public participation and available sanctions. This article argues that supply chain management by firms goes beyond business objectives by creating positive environmental externalities for society, and that more systematic study of the similarities and contrasts between the two forms of regulation may provide valuable lessons for both. Further, it may be possible to increase the effectiveness of private sector regulation to achieve both public societal and private business goals. From a business perspective, supply chain management enables firms to strategically redefine their relationships with government, reduce uncertainty and promote goal-oriented collaboration.

The analysis of the system of presumptions set up in the Technical Barriers to Trade Agreement and Sanitary and Phyto-Sanitary Agreement reveals that international standards are actually used as a ‘ceiling’ rather than a ‘floor’ benchmark of protection, contrary to their original spirit. They represent a codified and agreed yardstick for least trade-restrictive measures, a minimum compromise between the regulatory regime and the trade litigation machinery. It follows that their nature—at least within the WTO system—is irreversibly distorted; they are treated as facts rather than as safety or quality devices.},

Through a comparative case study of private regulation of sustainability standards in the forestry, clothing, IT-electronics, and chemicals industries, we show how a combination of low industrial concentration, civil society involvement in governance, and stringent standards of a first-moving regulator offer the strongest explanation for a fragmented private regulatory field, while high industrial concentration, business-driven governance, and lenient standards of a first-moving regulator lead to cohesive regulation.},

It is remarkable, however, that in one of the key industries referred to in this literature, the garments industry, convergence is virtually absent. This article explains why this is so and suggests that next to three existing approaches to the evolution and possible convergence of private governance organizations, actually a fourth, pessimistic type should be introduced, taking into account the evolution and perseverance of political difference between interest groups creating and supporting private governance arrangements.},

The author intends to prove the existence of such right. This indicates the growing number of EU legal acts providing human health protection from harmful environmental effects. The article introduce concepts of "environment", "healthy environment" and "human right to a healthy environment" and analyses origins and development of such right. The EU environmental policy development could be divided into four periods. This shows the growing efforts to regulate and limit negative environmentally based factors with the help of EU legal measures. Threats to environment and human health were better understood in basic objectives of Sixth EU Environmental Action Program. These objectives also highlight the importance of access to justice in environmental matters. Achievement of these goals depends on how the procedural side of the right to the healthy environment is strong; it is not sufficient just constant the existence of substantive right to a healthy environment. Despite there are no direct references and no direct statements constituting right to a healthy environment in EC Treaties establishing European Community, the existence of a number of EU legal acts providing legal statements proves the indirect maintenance of this type of human right in EU. Because of the lack of EU legal acts, implementing Convention on Access to information, Public Participation in Decision making and Access to Justice in Environmental Matters (Åarhus Covention), the real enforcing of an environmental human right to the healthy environment still remains weak. But a Proposal for a Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council on Access to Justice in Environmental Matters clearly points that adoption of needed EU acts implementing Åarhus Convention is on the way and this means more effective enforcement of this right in the future.},

The empirical research was carried out on the basis of qualitative access while conducting semi-structured interviews with representatives from different branches of science. As the results of the analysis show, despite the strained relations between scientific knowledge and power, Lithuanian scientists do not succeed in converting scientific knowledge into power. Even though scientists have enough knowledge, it is not transformed into power relations due to an existing specific context and the passive role of scientists themselves. Emerging decision-makers' efforts to eliminate scientists from Lithuanian energy security discourse formation pushes the latter into the vague situation in which it is difficult to expand their share of expectations. Analyses of the scientific discourse show that scientists interpret the energy events in a broader context: while analysing the processes and specific projects that seek to improve energy security, they notice a more comprehensive view and manage to identify advantages, disadvantages and uncertainties of the latter. While marking out the peculiarities of energy security discourse, it may be claimed that the role of the scientists is not significant; realizing the development of energy system there has not created an institutional mechanism for scientific expertise; scientists are not being involved and they do not rush to participate in the formation of energy security discourse.

Dozens of insurgents stormed into Xarardheere, a pirate cove on the central Somali coast, around noon, but instead of putting up a fight, the pirates sped off. According to witnesses, several pirate bosses raced out of town in luxury four-by-four trucks, with TVs packed in the back and mattresses strapped on top. Islamist fighters in a fleet of heavily armed pickup trucks then occupied the strategic points in town, including the defunct police station and several crossroads.},

@article{gevurtzGLOBALIZATIONCORPORATELAW2011,
  abstract = {Considerable scholarship during the last few decades addresses the question of whether corporate laws are becoming global by converging on commonly accepted approaches. Some scholars have asserted that such convergence is occurring around the most efficient laws and institutions, thereby marking the "End of History" for corporate law. This Article responds to such assertions by developing three claims not previously given due attention in the convergence literature. First, it demonstrates that the history of corporations and corporate law has been one of seemingly constant movement toward global convergence, yet the resulting convergence is always incomplete or transitory. Next, it points out that because forces besides efficiency also produce convergence, convergence often occurs around corporate laws and institutions that have no particular efficiency or other normative advantage, or that necessarily represent stable equilibrium points. Finally, the Article asks what are the important corporate laws and institutions by which to measure the extent of convergence at any one time. It develops the answer that a stable convergence is least likely for the most important corporate law issues, which are characterized by tensions between competing policies and no easy solutions for the problems presented.

However, the role of private authority in the regime complex – situations where non-state actors set rules or standards that other actors adopt – has only recently received academic attention. In this article, we ‘unbundle’ the concept of the regime complex in two novel ways. Firstly, we argue that an accurate depiction of any regime complex must also include private authority. Secondly, using examples from environmental governance, we carefully elaborate four specific mechanisms through which public and private authority interact, demonstrating the ways in which private authority can improve the problem-solving capacity of regime complexes. In short, a full understanding of the contributions of private authority to solving environmental problems requires examining its interactions with public rules and institutions.},

Alternatively, it might be thought that because the current counter-piracy operations in the GulfofAden are being conducted by naval forces, the appropriate law governing their actions should be the laws of armed conflict. On the contrary, 'this commentary confirms the view accepted by all governments involved in counter-piracy operations: that this is a law-enforcement operation to which the laws ofarmed conflict have no application. This follows from the fact that pirates are not in any relevant legal sense engaged in an armed conflict. Further, it is for from obvious that deeming the laws ofarmed conflict to be applicable would make the task ofnavies any easier on the one hand, or provide any greater human rights protection to suspect pirates on the other.

@article{guilfoyleProsecutingSomaliPirates2012,
  abstract = {It is commonly reported that numerous suspected Somali pirates encountered by navies are released without being sent for prosecution. This gives rise to a number of arguments, or assertions, including: that we are not prosecuting enough pirates (or not enough to create a deterrent effect); that the applicable international law is inadequate to the task of prosecuting pirates; or that some form of international (or internationally assisted) tribunal is required to ensure more effective prosecution of piracy suspects. Few of these arguments withstand sustained scrutiny. This article provides an overview of how Somali pirates are presently being prosecuted, the practical challenges faced by international navies and the applicable law. It will then consider in detail the options for prosecuting pirates that have been examined in a series of United Nations (UN) reports. These options are, broadly: prosecution before a national court or courts in the region (whether with or without UN assistance); prosecution before a special Somali court, sitting extra-territorially; establishing a regional court based on a treaty; establishing a 'hybrid' court in a national system based on a treaty with the UN; and establishing an international tribunal through a Chapter VII Security Council resolution under the UN Charter. It will be argued that international assistance for national prosecutions in the region is the only realistic solution, and that various legal issues working groups realized this and recommended this route as early as 2009. It appears the Security Council may have, finally and belatedly, accepted this view.},

@article{hathawayOutcastingEnforcementDomestic2011a,
  abstract = {This Article offers a new way to understand the enforcement of domestic and international law that we call "outcasting." Unlike the distinctive method that modern states use to enforce their law, outcasting is nonviolent: it does not rely on bureaucratic organizations, such as police or militia, that employ physical force to maintain order. Instead, outcasting involves denying the disobedient the benefits of social cooperation and membership. Law enforcement through outcasting in domestic law can be found throughout history - from medieval Iceland and classic canon law to modern-day public law. And it is ubiquitous in modern international law, from the World Trade Organization to the Universal Postal Union to the Montreal Protocol. Across radically different subject areas, international legal institutions use others (usually states) to enforce their rules and typically deploy outcasting rather than physical force. Seeing outcasting as a form of law enforcement not only helps us recognize that the traditional critique of international law — that it is not enforced and is therefore both ineffective and not real law—is based on a limited and inaccurate understanding of law enforcement. It also allows us to understand more fully when and how international law matters.},

  abstract = {[...] ... In particular, technological and scientific progress now enables mankind to explore, research and even exploit the resources of the world's most remote and inhospitable environment - the deep seabed - and Part XI of UNCLOS and its related international instruments (collectively referred to as the 'Seabed Regime') are dedicated to regulating deep seabed activities.5 The Seabed Regime has been described as one of the most complex legal regimes for international cooperation,6 and involves the intricate interaction of two fundamental legal notions that often arise when the management of natural resources is concerned: the 'common heritage of mankind' and the 'common concern of mankind'.7 The Seabed Disputes Chamber ('Chamber') of the International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea ('ITLOS') recently delivered a unanimous Advisory Opinion concerning the Responsibilities and Obligations of States Sponsoring Persons and Entities with respect to Activities in the Area.8 The Opinion - prompted in part by the 'Nautilus' of today, Nautilus Minerals Inc, part of whose application is extracted above - was principally concerned with clarifying the legal responsibilities, potential liabilities and required conduct of states who sponsor deep seabed mining by private contractors ('sponsoring states') with respect to such sponsorship relationships.9 The Opinion was formally requested by the Council of the International Seabed Authority (the 'Authority') under art 191 of UNCLOS,10 which reformulated an earlier request submitted by Nauru to seek an advisory opinion regarding the responsibility and liability of sponsoring states.11 Prior to making that request, Nauru and Tonga had asked the Legal and Technical Commission of the Authority to postpone consideration of their respective applications for approval of a plan of work for exploration in the areas reserved for the conduct of activities by the Authority through the Enterprise or in association with developing states pursuant to art 8 of annex III to UNCLOS.12 Each case involved the relevant state sponsoring a local subsidiary of Nautilus Minerals Inc in undertaking prospecting and exploration activities in respect of polymetallic nodules on the deep seabed in international waters, in accordance with the Seabed Regime (explained in greater detail in Part II below).13 The Legal and Technical Commission agreed to defer consideration of the applications, enabling Nauru and Tonga to obtain the benefit of the Opinion before being required to pursue or withdraw their respective applications.14 In delivering what has been viewed as a progressive and even 'historic'15 unanimous opinion, the Chamber drew heavily on principles of international environmental law and state responsibility more generally in seeking to manage the balance between effective utilisation of the seabed (the 'common heritage of mankind') and the need to protect the marine environment from pollution and ecosystem damage (the 'common concern of mankind').},

@report{hessbrueggeHumanRightsViolations2005,
  abstract = {The conduct of non-state actors can give rise to human rights violations to a greater extent than one would expect. Human rights law, interpreted in the light of general international law, applies to every private actor that is endowed with state power in any form. It applies to private entities that perform public functions and state-owned entities that are misused for political purposes. The state can also incur human rights responsibility for private conduct that it adopts as its own and for the conduct of de facto agents or hierarchically structured agent groups, over whom it exercises effective control. Finally, human rights responsibility also ensues where non-state groups, such as insurrectionary movements, usurp state power. The Westphalian paradigm of state responsibility has traditionally limited international law to hold only the state (rather than the usurpers themselves) responsible, but this short-coming is gradually being corrected as a customary norm emerges which extends human rights obligations also to non-state actors governing territory.Abuses of true non-state power are checked as well. Existential human rights are to be protected by reasonable and appropriate measures under all circumstances, bearing in mind countervailing human rights. In addition, the state has human rights obligations to protect the individual from non-state abuses of power, wherever access to public or tangible social goods is concerned and there is a disproportionate power relationship between the competing non-state actors.However, the current system suffers from one grave weakness. It is based on the premise that states are strong enough to check the range of agents that form part of the machinery of government, and that they can fulfill all their protective duties. If we are really experiencing a power shift away from the state and toward the non-state realm, this foundational premise becomes shaky. At the same time, as state capability to protect is weakening, their ambit of protective obligations to protect is widening, since the non-state sector expands into former state domains. The obvious answer would be to supplement the existing framework of vertical and diagonal human rights obligations with horizontal obligations for those non-state actors that seem to accumulate power, most prominently transnational corporations. The emerging duty for non-state actors not to become complicit in human rights violations of states is a first step in the right direction.},

Judicial dialogue leads to a more coherent transnational legal system, The Changing Role of Highest Courts in an Internationalising World, Project leaders: Professor Ton Hol, Professor John Bell, Professor Andrea Lollini
The report shows that rulemaking is becoming ever more international, private and informal. It analyses how the new rule making processes work and what benefits they have, and which challenges remain. Four major needs for innovation are identified. These needs clearly show: it is time for lawyers at ministries and courts to adjust their strategies. They cannot afford to ignore the impact of modern-style rulemaking on their work processes.},

@book{HoldingCorporationsAccountable,
  abstract = {At a time when the gigantic transnationals have a huge impact on human health, the environment, working conditions and the economic prospects of nations, this book explores whether it is sufficient to continue to rely on industry self-regulation alone.Before widening her focus to the general issues, the author examines the now famous case of the infant food industry. Almost two decades after the introduction of the WHO/Unicef Code seeking to regulate the marketing of formula milk substitutes, an estimated one and a half million babies die unnecessarily every year as a result of formula feeding. How effective, therefore, has the Code been in changing industry behaviour?The author argues that a key question today is how to foster a political climate favourable to practical institutional arrangements for the better regulation of TNCs. Recognizing the tension between global governance on the one hand and the globalized free market on the other, she urges that close attention be given to corporate conduct and TNC compliance with what regulatory codes exist. A range of relevant questions is explored, including the roles of citizen action, national governments and international agencies.A host of public concerns - for example, job losses when industries migrate or the introduction of GM crops without public consultation - point to corporate regulation as a looming political issue. This book contributes to the debate about how powerful corporations can pay regard not only to the bottom line, but also take more seriously their social responsibilities.},

  abstract = {Among the core doctrines of US contract law is that there are no punitive damages for a mere breach of contract. In fact, in many jurisdictions, a party can lie about or cover up a breach without risking punitive damages in fraud, under the rule that a breach cannot support an action for fraud. But government contracts are different. The False Claims Act (FCA) expressly prohibits government contractors from submitting "a false record or statement" material to a claim for payment. And under the judicially created doctrine of implied certification, a mere request for payment implicitly represents material compliance with the contract, as well as relevant statutes and regulations. This article aims to develop a theory of implied certification under the FCA and to recommend a way forward for both courts and contracting agencies. Implied certification of post-formation compliance plays an important role in the regulation of government contracts.},

Since their heyday, pirates have been transformed from bogeymen, such as the 18th-century sea bandit Blackbeard, into genial rascals, such as Johnny Depp's Captain Jack Sparrow in the Disney franchise Pirates of the Caribbean . Surely no other class of criminals has been detoxified so thoroughly? Piracy has a long history. The word was first used by an ancient Greek writer in around 140BC and pirates have since menaced every corner of the globe. Their place in western folklore owes much to the 17th and early 18th centuries, the so-called golden age of piracy, when pamphlets and books relayed tales of derring-do and nefarious deeds at sea to an avid readership. One such pamphlet, Newes from Sea, Of Two Notorious Pirates , was commissioned in 1609 by Shakespeare's publisher. It sold more copies than King Lear .},

"Floating armoury is a matter of very serious concern. This is entirely unregulated... This has very serious security implications for us including the infiltration of terrorists... If there are unregulated arms and ammunition on a vessel, the existence of weapons is not known as also where guards are transferring them and this could lead to such a situation on anybody's soil," Joshi said when asked if unregulated floating armouries can lead to 26/11-type attack.
He said over the years, these armouries providing escort to the merchant vessels plying in piracy prone areas have become a "loose-knit structure" and the "unregulated manner these ships are operating, there is no track of which ship is coming and what guards it has, what arms does it have and where they are going".},

These included environmental security, illegal immigration, human trafficking and piracy. This allowed UNCLOS to remain relatively flexible and current with international security concepts.

  abstract = {ISO/PAS 28007:2012 was developed as a maritime industry initiative to provide guidelines for ISO 28000 certified companies deploying Privately Contracted Armed Security Personnel (PCASP) on board ships.
It was specifically developed for organisations operating in the High Risk Area off the Horn of Africa, usually providing security transits from Suez to South East Asia and the Indian subcontinent. However, many of the certified or soon to be certified Private Maritime Security Companies equally apply the practices to operations in other parts of the world. It was developed via an abbreviated ISO process and will have to be reviewed before it becomes a full-fledged ISO Standard.
ISO/PAS 28007 does not adopt the International Code of Conduct principles, which were developed for the land rather than maritime environment.
The United Kingdom Accreditation Service ("UKAS") is the only national accreditation body that accredits auditing companies to certify to the standard. As of May 2014 only two certification bodies were actively certifying to ISO/PAS 28007: LRQA and MSS Global.
For another maritime private security standard, see ANSI/ASIS PSC.4-2013.},

The UN Law of the Sea Convention of 1982 provides a traditional though largely deficient set of rules for control and counter measures. Modern legal instruments such as the SUA Convention of 1988 as amended, recent resolutions of the UN Security Council and regional treaties try to fill the loopholes. Against this background the paper discusses e. g. the law of boarding and investigation of suspicious vessels, the arrest and penal prosecution of criminals and the right of self-defence in case of an imminent attack. The international mandates and the national rules of engagement in which the navies operate reflect these ambiguities that result in a loss of momentum. After all piracy is not an act of war, but a crime. In conclusion apolitical solution on land is indispensable as the navies and coast guards can only fight the symptoms and not the causes of crime and unrest in a failed State.},

  abstract = {Scholarly analysis of choices of law and forum tends to proceed from the moment of a choice having been made, or toward the possibility of its making. As a matter of private international law doctrine, the actual making of a contractual choice of law or forum is virtually unreadable. Corporate choices of law and forum in particular are typically projected as deliberate, measured, and coherent decisions, upon which normative constraints become operative only in anticipation of or after the fact. Yet such accounts sit uneasily with experiences of legal practice. Moreover, such projections of corporate integrity and autonomy are problematic by virtue of the types of inquiry and points of negotiation they foreclose. By way of a rejoinder, this article focuses ethnographically on corporate selections of law and forum in complex trans-boundary transactions. It contends that the factors shaping the enactment of choice in a complex deal are normatively irreducible to the apparently determined choices attributed to the entities in question and the principles of private international law that purport to uphold or constrain those choices. It argues, nonetheless, that corporate parties' enactments of autonomous preference tend to be structured in particular, patterned ways and it works to illuminate some of those patterns. In so doing, it recalls the contributions of legal realists to private international law, especially the work of Walter Wheeler Cook.},

The article aims to highlight the gap in accountability that exists within international and national law as well as the weaknesses of the existing theoretical and doctrinal approaches. Furthermore, it aims to de-mystify the role of international law in creating this accountability gap. The article proposes a new concept for the horizontal effect of fundamental human rights borrowing elements from systems-theory, especially from the work of Gunther Teubner. Finally, this article demonstrates the practicability of this concept.},

  abstract = {The management of fisheries at the international level is no longer the exclusive preserve of states and international organizations. The proliferation of private certification initiatives – the reach of which defies territorial boundaries – has heralded an era of transnational fisheries governance. Whereas the interactions between private standards and national regulation have attracted scholarly attention, the function of international law in the context of transnational fisheries governance is largely unexplored. This article maps the interactions between international fisheries law and the most prominent among private certification standards, namely the Marine Stewardship Council Fisheries Standard and Guidance (MSC FSG). The article proposes a methodology to assess such interactions at the stage of norm development and argues that the interactions between the two regimes are multidirectional and complex. International law serves as a model for private standard setting and as a yardstick for private decision making. Conversely, the MSC FSG has acted as a model for the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations Ecolabelling Guidelines. Moreover, the MSC FSG may constitute a benchmark for resolutions adopted by regional fisheries management organizations. The MSC FSG, in incorporating international fisheries law, affirms the latter’s resilience as a global point of reference for the management of fisheries globally. Yet, at the same time, by prompting states to comply with their international obligations in order to secure market access for their fishing industry, the MSC FSG may be exposing the inability of international law to generate compliance autonomously.},

The paper also provides a discussion about the decisions of the Strasbourg court and the Court of Justice of the European Union, which provide the basis of solving the problem of the relationship of these systems of law. In the second part of this paper, the main theories are analysed: the monistic, dualistic and coordination theories, which can be used to answer the issue of interaction of the two systems of law - international law and European Union law.

  abstract = {[This commentary considers a number of potential threats to security originating from the global commons. While direct attacks on a state from vessels and aircraft passing through the global commons constitute such threats, this paper focuses upon challenges posed by possible action against maritime activity occurring outside the territorial sea and national airspace. In this context, there are vulnerabilities surrounding a variety of activities in the global commons. These include threats to international maritime trade and fisheries, possible attacks on offshore oil and gas installations, and interference with pipelines and submarine cables. There are significant limitations on the ability of a coastal state to respond within international law. This commentary considers the nature of jurisdiction beyond the territorial sea, and investigates what protective and responsive actions are available to states. It concludes by considering current international developments which provide for cooperation in intelligence, surveillance and interdiction, and greater use of port state control to circumvent these jurisdictional limitations.},

This paper provides an overview of different aspects of maritime piracy problems with particular reference to the need for integrated counter-piracy initiatives. A total success in combating piracy demands active global participation, with particular reference to the (i) identification of root causes, (ii) development of effective rehabilitation plans, (iii) global brain storming for comprehensive and appropriate adaptive solutions, (iv) balance between military and political efforts, (v) strong international cooperation and pirate network disintegration efforts, and (vi) development of a clear legal prosecution system with suitable mechanisms to ensure effective enforcement of the regulations.},

  abstract = {In recent years it has become commonplace to refer to the development of a ‘regulatory state’ in a number of advanced societies (Loughlin and Scott, 1997; Majone, 1994, 1997; Moran, 2002, 2003). The description was used originally to characterize the United States and the growing use of state law and regulatory administrative agencies by the federal government in the early decades of the twentieth century, predominantly to curb the market-limiting and monopoly-exploiting powers of big business. It was then extended in the 1960s to apply to burgeoning social regulation in the United States in areas such as discrimination and consumer protection, and has become a description used to typify in recent years a diffusion of regulatory reforms throughout the world. However, as we shall see, ‘the regulatory state’ is now found in quite changed economic, social and political circumstances to those that occurred as recently as three or four decades ago. These changes may be located in the role of the state — towards the economy, towards professional and other self-regulatory associations, and to social risk — and also to the way in which social ordering and control itself has been reconceptualized in academic and other analyses.},

It focuses on the historical embedding of investment protection as a means of facilitating economic development as well as upon its synthetic public law nature. The analysis shows that a teleological approach to interpretation imposes boundaries on the meaning of substantive IIA provisions. The article then elaborates how the transnational dimension of IIAs provides a benchmark, which is the level of protection offered to economic actors against interference by the state in countries with the highest rule of law standards. The article then shows how the resulting challenges of comparative public law could be addressed through the methodology of re- and pre-statement of transnational uniform ‘principles’: sophisticated and detailed rules striking the proper balance between private economic interests and the public regulatory interest, so as to provide more legal certainty for both investors and host states.},

Compatibility of marine protected areas with the regime of the 1982 United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea is analysed in part 2 of this paper. Part 3 of this paper describes various types of marine protected areas that have been designated within the waters of the Baltic Sea: Special Area under MARPOL 73/78 Convention, Particularly Sensitive Sea Area under respective regulations of the International Maritime Organization, Baltic Sea Protected Areas under Convention on the Protection of the Marine Environment in the Baltic Sea Area, Special Protection Areas and Special Areas of Conservation under European Union directives as well as other areas established under Lithuanian national legislation. Legal regime associated with the status of each of the aforementioned areas and its effectiveness is also being reviewed. At the end of this paper certain conclusions as regards the system of marine protected areas in the waters of the Baltic Sea and the scope of protective measures applicable in such areas are drawn.},

While a number of western states cooperated in taking enforcement measures off the coast of Somalia for the suppression and deterrence of acts of piracy and armed robbery against ships, they were reluctant to prosecute captured pirates in their domestic courts. A number of captured pirates were, therefore, transferred to Somalia’s neighboring states for prosecution or otherwise releas ...},

We argue that international actors are goal-seeking agents who make specific institutional design choices to solve the particular cooperation problems they face in different issue-areas. In this article we introduce the theoretical framework of the Rational Design project. We identify five important features of institutions-membership, scope, centralization, control, and flexibility-and explain their variation in terms of four independent variables that characterize different cooperation problems: distribution, number of actors, enforcement, and uncertainty. We draw on rational choice theory to develop a series of empirically falsifiable conjectures that explain this institutional variation. The authors of the articles in this special issue of International Organization evaluate the conjectures in specific issue-areas and the overall Rational Design approach.},

  abstract = {Abstract The second half of the twentieth century saw major improvements in the legal regime for fisheries management. This notwithstanding, the deep seas remain largely unregulated under international law, until recently only being covered by the general environmental and management provisions found in UNCLOS. In light of this regulatory gap, this article evaluates the potential law-making effects, if any, of the FAO Deep-Sea Fisheries Guidelines, a voluntary instrument designed to provide States with a regulatory framework for the management of their deep-sea fisheries. It considers how the Guidelines may inform, interpret and influence the content of the general high-sea obligations in UNCLOS. Despite the vagueness and generality of those provisions, some indication of their substantive content has been given in recent decisions, particularly the South China Sea Arbitration . By assessing their compatibility, and their level of acceptance by the international community, this article argues that the FAO Deep-Sea Guidelines are beginning to have a law-making effect by providing an authoritative interpretation of the general high-sea obligations found in UNCLOS relating to deep-sea fisheries.},

  abstract = {Transboundary problems have provided serious challenges for states’ governance capacity for long. As a result, the modern state has not only begun to adapt its own administrative and regulatory structures; it has also come to rely increasingly on effective institutional structures for cooperation and governance on a regional and global scale. The classical instrument for international cooperation, international law, can only provide such structures under certain conditions and within strict limits. Governments have therefore turned to alternative forms of transnational ordering, which in some cases have indeed led to more effective decision-making – key among them formal international institutions, informal government networks, extraterritorial regulation, and links with private forms of regulation. However, all of these tools come with drawbacks – some are more effective than others, and the more they are effective, the more they tend to entail a loss of control for national governments, regulators and administrators. Domestic authorities have sought to readjust and develop new forms of influence in transnational regulatory contexts, some of them resulting in asymmetrical structures that increase the capacity of some countries’ institutions while constraining those of others. In this paper, I analyze the different forms of transnational law- and rule-making with respect to their varying impacts on, and links with, domestic governance institutions, and I place a particular focus on the most prominent example – the rise of informal institutions and transgovernmental networks in global regulation.},

@online{lambooijCorporateSocialResponsibility2010,
  abstract = {Corporate social responsibility (CSR) as a nominal term clearly resonates with scholars and practitioners alike. As a scientific concept, however, it has often been criticized for its lack of definitional precision and poor measurement. The upshot of this analysis is that since the
CSR concept adds nothing of value to existing frameworks in the field of management and organisation, such as the economizing and legitimizing perspectives, it is best to discard it altogether.
Generally, criticasters have also contended that CSR distracts from the fundamental
economic role of businesses. From a different perspective, CSR has
been criticised as being nothing more than superficial window-dressing. Along
those lines, as one of the downsides, it has been asserted that CSR could become the victim of its own popularity. For example, the campaign group Friends of the Earth sees some companies’ interest in CSR as a cynical ‘PR exercise’. Hence, in their view, ‘greenwashing’ – self-styled ethical brands – could suffer a backlash from their own CSR spin. Another critical argument
often disseminated is that CSR is an attempt to pre-empt the role of governments
as a watchdog over powerful multinational corporations.
Clearly, the CSR phenomenon has attracted strong positive and negative opinions from both scientists and society. On the one hand, the author agrees with the criticisms conversed; they provide a realistic view and certainly contain an element of truth. However, as will be demonstrated throughout
this study, she also agrees with the view of Porter and Kramer. If businesses
were to use the same frameworks that guide their core business, CSR could be
effectively incorporated into the core operations and could become a source of
opportunity, innovation, and competitive advantage for business, as well as a
source of social progress. As will be explained infra, the author has chosen to
direct her research towards legal and semi-legal frameworks that support and
guide business organisations and to examine how these frameworks interact
with CSR.},

@report{levi-faur_transnational_2014,
  abstract = {This paper’s first aim is to present and extend the regulatory governance approach for transnational politics and policy. The advantages and challenges of this approach are discussed both in relation to what the regulatory governance perspective means and what this approach should strive to highlight and capture beyond what it does now. Its second aim is to develop a three-way framework of regulatory interactions. This framework shifts the focus of transnational politics and policy analysis from rule-makers (RM) to rule-takers (RT) and rule-intermediaries (RI). To build our theoretical argument, we employ as an illustrative case one of the most catastrophic failures of transnational governance: The deadly fire in a certified textile factory in Karachi, Pakistan. We use this failure, where regulatory intermediaries certified a dangerous sweatshop just weeks before the fire, to demonstrate the relevance, the failure, and the importance of a three-way framework. Our three-way interaction framework (a) integrates the growing literature on private governance more closely with the regulation literature; (b) reveals the complexity of regulatory architectures and, therefore, the need for a more complex analysis of interests, power, and accountability; (c) allows the more effective assignment of responsibility and demand for accountability, and (d) sheds more light on the nature of interactions in regulatory systems in general and transnational interactions in particular.},

Medicines and tobacco products lie at polar opposite ends of the health spectrum, and are regulated for vastly different reasons and through different tools and approaches. Nevertheless, attempts to govern counterfeit trade in each of these products raise a host of somewhat similar challenges, involving normative and operational conflicts that cut across the crowded intersection of health protection and promotion, intellectual property protection, and activity to combat transnational organized crime. As negotiations of an illicit trade protocol to the WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control enter their final stages, lessons learned from counterfeit medicines governance need to be applied to ensure that the most appropriate governance arrangements are adopted.

  abstract = {Recent research on regulation and governance suggests that a mixture of public and private interventions is necessary to improve working conditions and environmental standards within global supply chains. Yet less attention has been directed to how these different forms of regulation interact in practice. The form of these interactions is investigated through a contextualized comparison of suppliers producing for Hewlett-Packard, one of the world's leading global electronics firms. Using a unique dataset describing Hewlett-Packard's supplier audits over time, coupled with qualitative fieldwork at a matched pair of suppliers in Mexico and the Czech Republic, this study shows how private and public regulation can interact in different ways — sometimes as complements; other times as substitutes — depending upon both the national contexts and the specific issues being addressed. Results from our analysis show that private interventions do not exist within a vacuum, but rather these efforts to enforce labour and environmental standards are affected by state and non-governmental actors.},

With his 9/11 nightmare United 93 (2006) and his Northern Ireland drama Bloody Sunday (2002), I came down with these same symptoms: shallow breathing, heart arrhythmia, a high-pitched keening coming from somewhere behind clenched teeth and a tendency to grab the red plush of the seat in front.

But there is another way to assess these buccaneers: as businessmen, who have smartly figured out the way trade is flowing, and how to get their share. The booming piracy industry is a neat metaphor for our globalised economy.

@article{mattliAccountabilityAccountingPolitics2005,
  abstract = {Over recent decades governments have increasingly delegated domestic and international regulatory functions to private-sector agents. This article examines the reasons for such delegation and how private agents differ from public ones, and then analyzes the politics of regulation post delegation. It argues that the key difference between delegation to a public agent and delegation to a private one is that in the latter case a multiple-principals problem emerges that is qualitatively different from the one usually considered in the literature. An agent's action will be determined by the relative tightness of competing principal–agent relationships. This tightness is a function of the relative importance of each principal for the agent's financial and operational viability as well as its effectiveness in rule making. Further, the article posits that exogenous changes in the macro-political climate can deeply affect the nature of principal–agent relationships. The authors test their hypotheses about the politics of regulation in the postdelegation period through the study of accounting standards setting in the United States, a case of delegation of regulatory authority to a private agent that goes back to the New Deal era and has received renewed public attention in the wake of recent corporate financial scandals.},

The pooling of capacities in the pursuit of common goals seems perfectly sensible. Yet although the strategy of cooptation has become a policy of choice, policy makers often lack full knowledge of its implications. As Philip Selznick first showed, cooptation can have unintended consequences, shifting leadership from one organization to another. We place this fertile insight in a better specified analytical framework. That is, one capable of explaining when and how leadership shifts occur and where the status quo leaders will remain at the helm. Using original interview data and structured focused comparisons to test the framework, we reveal dramatic variation in leadership changes following the cooptation of outside actors in global financial and environmental governance.},

These methods include recourse to public courts and more frequently to private international courts, such as the International Court of Arbitration of the International Chamber of Commerce or the London Court of International Arbitration, as well as recourse to so-called ad hoc arbitration and alternative dispute-resolution techniques, such as conciliation and mediation. The key institutional dimensions along which these methods of international dispute resolution vary are (1) procedural and adaptive flexibility, and (2) centralization of procedural safeguards and information collection. I explain why different methods of international commercial dispute resolution are selected. I argue that these methods respond to the varying institutional needs of different types of disputes and disputants. Such needs can be explained in terms of the severity of the enforcement problem, uncertainty about the preferences or behavior of contractual partners, and uncertainty about the state of the world.},

@article{mattliSettingInternationalStandards2003,
  abstract = {Standards have become one of the most important nontariff barriers to trade, especially national product standards that specify design or performance characteristics of manufactured goods. Divergent national standards often inhibit trade, whereas regional and international standards increasingly serve as instruments of trade liberalization. Consequently, the setting of international standards-seemingly technical and apolitical-is rapidly becoming an issue of economic and political salience. But who sets international standards? Who wins, who loses? This article offers a fresh analytical approach to the study of international standards, which the authors call the institutional complementarities approach. It builds on insights from realism and the "Battle of the Sexes" coordination game but emphasizes complementarities of historically conditioned standardization systems at the national level with the institutional structure of standardization at the international level. It posits that, after controlling for other factors that influence involvement in international standardization, differences in institutional complementarities play a critical though largely accidental role in placing firms from different countries or regions in a first- or second-mover position when standardization becomes global. The authors illustrate the insightfulness of this approach through statistical analyses of the first scientific set of data on standards use and standardization, collected by the authors through an international online survey.},

Initial concerns voiced by BIMCO centred on the description of the 100 Series RUF as an “international benchmark standard rules for the use of force” that would protect privately contracted armed security personnel in the event of a trial. BIMCO chief maritime security officer Giles Noakes said those concerns had now been resolved, allowing the shipping industry association to lend collaborative support to further development of a document that will now be described as an international model set of maritime rules for the use of force. “BIMCO has always supported the concept of a common set of rules for the use of force—but to be viable, they would need to be recognised internationally,” he said. The 100 Series RUF has now been presented to the International Standards Organisation, for consideration to supplement the recently published international standard for armed guards, ISO PAS 28007."

@article{michaelsEconomicsLawChoice2008,
  abstract = {If economics is about choice, then economics of law should be about choice of law. In a broad sense, this is the case. Normative law and economics tells us what kinds of legal regimes to choose from the various models we can think of; choice of law tells us which of actually existing regimes applies. In view of this similarity in sensitivities between choice of law and law and economics, it is not surprising that we see law and economics applied to choice of law. Where choice of law is viewed as too conceptual and abstract, economics promises much-needed pragmatism. Where choice-of-law doctrine is chided for its oblivion to the practical impact of its rules, law and economics promises to provide empirical foundations. Where choice of law is viewed as devoid of theory, economics promises to be that theory. Where choice of law is viewed as hopelessly complex, economics promises to provide clear guidelines. This article analyzes how far economic models can function as doctrine. It finds that economics does not and probably cannot fulfill this function. It is the heroic failure of economic analysis, not its claimed success, that presents a real, and immensely valuable, contribution. Economic models achieve clarity, but the unrealistic abstractions necessary to achieve it only highlight the inescapable messiness of the problems with choice of law. The isolation of certain values in the economic analysis, especially those of private and public ordering, respectively, shows that it is the combination of, and the conflict between, these values that defines the field. The failure of attempts to develop new solutions on the basis of abstract economic reasoning, regardless of existing doctrine, makes us see clearly the high degree of disciplinary knowledge that is present, though often unacknowledged, within our doctrinal concepts and rules, imperfect as they are.},

It has, however, been frequently criticised for its uncertainty and discretionary character. This article looks at the justifications for limits on public policy in private international law, and considers three principles which should constrain the application of public policy – proximity, relativity and seriousness of breach. It then analyses the practice of English courts through the perspective of these three ‘dimensions’. While the courts do not expressly acknowledge these principles, they not only explain the majority of cases involving the application of (or refusal to apply) public policy in private international law, but also provide reasons why certain decisions have been considered unsatisfactory. The argument developed in this article thus suggests an analytical framework through which the application of public policy in private international law might be made more certain, principled and justifiable.},

The article begins by discussing the history of private international law, presenting and contextualising Asser’s public international perspective, highlighted by his foundational role in the Hague Conferences on Private International Law. It then turns to analyse the subsequent fragmentation of private international law into discrete national approaches, which have often emphasised private rights. The article then discusses recent changes in private international law in the European Union, Canada and Australia, and characterises them as a revival of a more public perspective, which presents fresh challenges for private international law. It argues that these modern developments should be understood and welcomed as at least a partial rediscovery of the ‘public’ dimension of private international law, and thus as signposts of a return to Asser’s globalist vision.},

Within the international regime controlling intentional oil pollution, a provision requiring tanker owners to install specified equipment produced dramatically higher levels of compliance than a provision requiring tanker operators to limit their discharges. Since both provisions entailed strong economic incentives for violation and regulated the same countries over the same time period, the variance in compliance clearly can be attributed to different features of the two subregimes. The equipment requirements' success stemmed from establishing an integrated compliance system that increased transparency, provided for potent and credible sanctions, reduced implementation costs to governments by building on existing infrastructures, and prevented violations rather than merely deterring them.},

  abstract = {Today’s interconnected economy is dependent on petroleum products as a principal component of the energy mix and a critical element in global infrastructures. With the escalating demand for oil and natural gas, the world relies heavily on maritime transportation to move 62 \% of world trade on fixed routes. The Persian Gulf countries are crucial because about 88 \% of oil exports pass through the Strait of Hormuz. The Strait is strategically located between Iran and Oman, where 20 million barrels of crude oil per day is carried by supertankers. These shipments account for 40 \% of seaborne oil traded worldwide. According to the Energy Information Administration, due to increasing demand this region will require 2.5 times more tankers than are in existence today to meet demand by 2025. Nevertheless, the persistent, expanding, and increasingly sophisticated physical attacks against maritime transportation present an alarming pattern. The focus of this article is three fold. First, to explain major transnational threats within the context of piracy and terrorism. Second, to present the costs and the economic impacts of piracy and terrorism on international trade. Third, to point out the main contributing factors involved in the increase in the number of attacks on maritime petroleum transportation vessels. Given the strategic importance of the Persian Gulf countries, due to their petroleum contributions to the world, this paper focuses on the maritime flows of petroleum from this region through navigation courses to Asia, the United States, and Europe.},

@thesis{mykooRoleResponsibilityMinor2003,
  abstract = {This dissertation is a study to determine the role and responsibility of the minor stakeholders in the elimination of substandard shipping and it s impact on their pursuit for profitability in a very dynamic shipping industry. The shipping industry is examined to determine the origin and nature of substandard shipping, within the context of maritime safety and environmental protection, and the environment that fosters its continued existence. The efforts of governments through
a regulatory regime and various international identities (major stakeholders), to deter and where necessary apprehend substandard shipping is analysed. The need for the support of the market players (minor stakeholders), in the overall process of eliminating substandard shipping is established.
The economic pursuit of the minor stakeholders, along with their obligations and response to safety and environmental regulations being integrated in the shipping market dynamics, are all examined. The relatively dormant notion of self-regulation of the shipping industry is explored, w
ith the objective of giving it greater prominence. The concept of quality shipping and its antecedents of transparency and safety culture, as well as an appropriate regulatory regime that would enhance the concept, are also examined. Finally, the propeller principle is conceptualized as a representation of the cooperating, coordination, and dynamics involved in pursuing the goal of quality shipping},

  abstract = {Compliance with international standards is now a sine qua non for entry into globalized production networks. Developing country firms and farms are confronted by an array of distinct product and process standards that they must meet. This has heightened the competitive challenges they face. Non-compliance can result in exclusion from profitable markets. This article uses the recent case of Nike's termination of sourcing of soccer balls from its lead supplier in Pakistan as a lens to analyse the relationship between standards and governance. The article addresses first the global governance implications associated with how standards are being shaped and implemented. Second, it considers how global standards affect the governance of value chain ties. Finally, in terms of questions for further research, it suggests the need to explore the relationship between standards and ‘intra-firm’ governance, in particular to assess outcomes for those engaged within the chains—namely local firms and their workers, and the social contexts in which global standards are imposed from the outside.},

Then: "PAPA-PAPA", the captain's familiar voice over the Tannoy. He repeats the code name again followed by "All crews to emergency stations, all crews to emergency stations."

With attacks becoming more widespread and violent, including the increase in kidnapping for ransom, industry has now identified an urgent need to update these Guidelines. They also now take into account the regionally established Maritime Trade Information Centre (MTISC). Although piracy in the Gulf of Guinea region in many ways differs from that of Somalia-based piracy, large sections of the Best Management Practices already developed by industry to help protect against Somalia-based piracy are also valid in the Gulf of Guinea region. Consequently, these Guidelines aim to bridge the gap between the advice currently found in BMP4 and the prevailing situation in the Gulf of Guinea region. These Guidelines should therefore be read in conjunction with BMP4 and will make reference to BMP4 where relevant. The Guidelines have been developed by BIMCO, ICS, INTERCARGO and INTERTANKO and are supported by NATO Shipping Centre. A soft copy of BMP4 can be found on the websites of these organisations.},

  abstract = {This is the story behind another story. Inspired by the anthropological practice of reflexivity, it traces some practical, epistemological, ethical, and existential questions behind a book based on empirical socio-legal research into international criminal law in situations of conflict. The challenges involved in such research are at times impossible to overcome. Indeed, the challenges may be such that the researcher will never be able to answer her original question fully and confidently. However, challenges can be findings in themselves. They may reveal insights into the role of law in a society, the limitations of vocabularies, the overexposure of international criminal law, and inequalities in global knowledge production. Rather than merely obstructing research into a topical issue, challenges may shift the researcher's attention to other, more fundamental, questions. Nonetheless, understanding challenges as findings does not resolve the existential problem of the researcher's possible complicity in maintaining the very challenges that she analyses and perhaps ambitiously tries to overcome.

Maritime piracy has a long history as a threat to international security and was in fact the first international crime. Yet piracy was excluded from the Rome Statute. In the years since the drafting of the Rome Statute, piracy has increased dramatically to become more like the threat it was in the “Golden Age of Piracy”. Criminal accountability for piracy has been minimal, due to logistical and jurisdictional difficulties. This paper offers an analysis of the potential of the ICC for prosecuting pirates: why it should be considered as a potential forum for ensuring criminal accountability for piracy, how piracy fits within the ICC's jurisdiction, and whether or not piracy should be added to the Rome Statute as a stand-alone crime or under the rubric of crimes against humanity.},

This Handbook provides a clear and authoritative discussion of the major trends and issues in regulation over the last thirty years, together with an outline of prospective developments. It brings together contributions from leading scholars from a range of disciplines and countries. Each chapter offers a broad overview of key current issues and provides an analysis of different perspectives on those issues. Experiences in different jurisdictions and insights from various disciplines are drawn upon, and particular attention is paid to the challenges that are encountered when specific approaches are applied in practice. Contributors develop their own distinctive arguments relating to the central issues in regulation and apply scholarly rigour and clear writing to matters of high policy-relevance. The essays are original, accessible, and agenda-setting, and the Handbook will be essential reading both to students and researchers and to with regulatory and regulated professionals.},

The World Trade Organization (WTO) exercises a high level of deference towards international standards, requiring their use. However, practice shows that several international standards are adopted through opaque and exclusionary processes. In line with this observation, in its recent US-Tuna II ruling, the Appellate Body adopted a more critical approach regarding international standards. Against this backdrop, this paper focuses on an analysis of the properties and mechanics of international standard-setting processes within the International Organization for Standardization (ISO), discussing procedural and substantive guarantees regarding transparency, openness, deliberation and participation. As the WTO becomes the de facto arbiter of the legitimacy of international standards, much-needed institutional reform in international standard-setting is bound to occur, in line with emerging demands for a more inclusive global legal order.},

Instead of grappling with the difficult question of whether Congress intended a law to reach beyond US borders, some courts have side-stepped it entirely. Courts have done so by redefining extraterritoriality. Here, Parrish laments the birth of this troubling new approach, where established law is jettisoned and legislative jurisdiction analysis is evaded. Redefining extraterritoriality not only subverts established doctrine, it removes an important safeguard to the difficulties that extraterritorial regulation creates. More problematically, the practice undercuts principles that have been foundational in both domestic and international law.},

@article{percyMercenariesStrongNorm2007,
  abstract = {In this article I examine how a weak international law can be created despite the presence of a strong norm, and I use weak law to probe the relationship between social and legal norms. International law dealing with mercenaries is notoriously flawed. These flaws have been attributed to the idea that state interest (or lack of interest) led to the development of intentionally weak law. In fact, ineffective anti-mercenary law is the result of the influence of norms. A strong norm against mercenary use has led states to devise a definition that indicated what they found problematic about mercenaries, and differentiated mercenaries from other actors. This definition followed the anti-mercenary norm but created a number of loopholes, which were made worse by the fact that commitment to the norm was so strong that states were unable to make adjustments necessary to create more effective law. The development of the law against mercenaries was further undermined by the pressures of a competing norm. During the 1980s, creation of a UN Convention to deal with mercenaries was stymied by the fact that many states were seeking to protect the norm of state responsibility, and the conflict between this norm and the anti-mercenary norm delayed the Convention to such a degree it was superseded by events. Weak anti-mercenary law, created in the presence of a strong anti-mercenary norm, can demonstrate four things about the relationship between social and legal norms: that states advocate the creation of law because of what it is rather than what it does; that legal institutionalization is not necessarily good for the further development of a norm; that strong commitment to a norm can lead to the creation of weak law; and that social and legal norms might not differ because the latter is more effective.},

Convergence advocates point to the structural pressures of the global economy on countries, while the divergence school points to the embeddedness of domestic regulatory institutions. This paper examines cross-national divergence in adoption rates of ISO 14001, an important international nongovernmental environmental regime developed with the cooperation of multinational firms. ISO 14001 offers a process-based system of voluntary regulation instead of an outcome-based system of public regulation that many firms find cumbersome. Our analysis of data from 59 countries suggests that ISO 14001 adoption rates are likely to be higher in countries whose trading partners have adopted this nongovernmental regime, which are embedded in international networks of nongovernmental organizations, whose governments flexibly enforce stringent environmental regulations with a less adversarial and litigious stance towards firms, and where consumers want mechanisms for identifying environmentally progressive firms.},

While this may bring greater security to ships and their crews, it also raises a number of important issues, especially what constitutes lawful use of force by armed guards belonging to PMSCs. It is sometimes a fine line between lawful self-defence and homicide, but it is one that needs to be drawn clearly. This article discusses the applicable standards — human rights as well as other relevant frameworks and standards — and concludes that further work is required to ensure that the rights of all concerned are respected and protected.},

pirates. It further describes the initiatives taken to develop a sustainable mechanism in

@report{richemond-barakCanSelfRegulationWork2013,
  abstract = {Various efforts have been undertaken in recent years to clarify the legal framework governing the outsourcing of security and military functions to private actors. While national and international legislation have made little progress, self-regulation has advanced steadily. The article provides the first normative assessment of self-regulation in the private security and military industry – and as such offers insights for other industries that are transnational in reach and under-regulated by domestic, regional, and international law. Though industry critics tend to deplore the normative 'softness' of self-regulation and its voluntary nature, it appears to have shifted behavioral norms and triggered a compliance pull. Its weakness, I argue, lies elsewhere: regrettably, emerging self-regulatory schemes in the industry focus on monitoring (as opposed to sanctioning) and on corporate accountability (as opposed to individual accountability). To overcome these limitations, I suggest the adoption of an OECD-type model of governance for the private security and military industry. The model would combine the use of regional bodies at the monitoring level with an international supervisory body at the sanctioning level. Unlike existing regulatory schemes, the proposed model has the ability to monitor and sanction both corporations and their employees – something none of the proposals currently on the table contemplates. At a time where many industries struggle to find optimal modes of governance, the Article draws attention to an industry where much creativity has been shown. Beyond the lessons learned for the regulation of war and security, the experience of the private security and military industry highlights the potential of a mode of governance that has somewhat fallen out of fashion, the benefits of involving certain non-state actors in law-making, and the need to reflect on the nature of the 'law' thus developed.},

  abstract = {International business transactions are heavily influenced by culture, practice and rule. The pursuit of business relationships within nation-states can be subject to differences in the generation of norms and the processing of disputes, but these conflicts are magnified many times over in cross-border transactions where nation-state control and support is weak or absent. This book seeks different explanations of the ways in which business people and their legal advisers try to minimize the effect of these magnified difficulties. At the outset, four sources are suggested through which the international business community might be considered to have supplemented nation-state conflict prevention and dispute resolution institutions - an international legal order, the development of a private normative order based on common business practices (denominated the lex mercatoria), through the efforts and work product of internationalized law firms, and by means of extensive, thick personal relationships often referred to by their Chinese term guanxi. Since most explanations are dominated by North American and European legal scholarship and practice, a second concern of this book is to open up the discussion to competing explanatory frameworks. Specifically, it develops the notion that global legal convergence may not be the immediate, inevitable result of increased global economic interaction. Rather, less formal mechanisms for achieving normative understanding and predictability in business dealings may also flourish.},

  abstract = {Abstract In attempts to improve the efficiency of development efforts over the past few decades private sector participation in the delivery of basic services has been promoted to a varying extent. Roughly in tandem with this, there has been movement to increase the accountability of corporations, particularly transnational corporations (TNCs), for human rights violations. Rather than engaging directly in the legal debate about the applicability of human rights standards to corporate activity, this article essentially looks at the issue from the inside out through the collection of empirical evidence. By focusing on the emergent right to water as a case-study, it examines how TNCs engaged in water service delivery in the development context understand and use the language of rights. In doing so, it discusses how current engagement by the TNCs with human rights language may influence proposed corporate human rights accountability frameworks and current attempts to close the globalisation governance gap.},

The narrator, a teenage girl called Amy, is being held hostage by Somali pirates on her family's luxury yacht. Her father is Hostage One; her stepmother Hostage Two; Amy is Hostage Three. There's a gun to her head, and she is about to be executed. It's hard to imagine a more arresting opening. This is very much what creative writing textbooks mean when they talk about starting a story in medias res. It's impossible not to be hooked. But there's a risk. Frontloading a narrative means that nothing else is likely to match the beginning for sheer intensity. And so it proves with Hostage Three - yet as it rewinds to show us the events leading up to that opening, Nick Lake's story develops not into the white-knuckle ride you might predict, but into something more complex, with unexpected political intelligence and emotional power.},

@article{scassaNewFirstPrinciples2011,
  abstract = {The globalized and decentralized Internet has become the new locus for a wide range of human activity, including commerce, crime, communications and cultural production. Activities which were once at the core of domestic jurisdiction have moved onto the Internet, and in doing so, have presented numerous challenges to the ability of states to exercise jurisdiction. In writing about these challenges, some scholars have characterized the Internet as a separate "space" and many refer to state jurisdiction over Internet activities as "extraterritorial." This article examines these challenges in the context of the overall international law of jurisdiction, rather than focusing on any one substantive area. This article argues that while the Internet may push at the boundaries of traditional principles of jurisdiction in public international law, it has not supplanted them. The article explores the principles of jurisdiction, including the evolving concept of "qualified territoriality," and demonstrates how these principles continue to apply in the Internet context. The article examines how states exercise their authority with respect to Internet activities by addressing governance issues, by engaging in normative ordering for the Internet, and by extending the reach of their domestic laws to capture Internet-based activities. Lastly, the article concludes by offering a set of "first principles," in the form of policy precepts, to guide the evolution of public international law norms and to address problems particular to the context of the global Internet.},

  abstract = {Maritime piracy is an ancient problem that harms, either directly or indirectly, many states as well as non-state actors. Although the law on piracy seems in principle adequately equipped to deal with the problem, states have not been able to fully repress piracy, and navies have not been able to sufficiently protect commercial vessels against attacks. As a consequence, ship-owners have started to hire Privately Contracted Armed Security Personnel (PCASP) in order to protect vessel, cargo and crew. The task of a flag state to provide security to commercial vessels flying its flag is increasingly being outsourced. As a result, accountability issues may arise from the conduct of PCASP operating on board a commercial vessel. The need to regulate PCASP operating at sea is more widely acknowledged. The focus of this chapter is on the role and obligations, under both international human rights law and the law of the sea, of flag states. The possibility of state responsibility, and the practice of the Netherlands in this context will also be discussed. The chapter will end with some concluding remarks on whether international law is adequately developed and tailored to deal with the issue at hand.},

And one of the most puzzling questions that cyberspace lawyers have been facing is where and in which form law is to be found on the Internet. This essay seeks to build a bridge between these two issues. The main argument is that, on the Internet and more specifically in the context of eBay (the online marketplace) and with regard to certain aspects of domain names, private spheres of normativity may be found that deserve to be considered as the epitome of private legal systems more so than the lex mercatoria. These systems provide fertile ground to test some of the most classical issues regarding the concept of a legal system and thereby to reflect on the essential features of law. This Article is thus a discussion of legal pluralism based on examples provided by the Internet. These particularly revealing examples are used to shed some light on issues such as the distinction between social and legal norms, the autonomy of a legal system, and law’s supposed features of supremacy, territorial exclusiveness and comprehensiveness.},

At first glance TPR regimes raise significant problems of legitimacy because of a degree of detachment from traditional government mechanisms. A variety of models have emerged engaging businesses, associations of firms, and NGOs, sometimes in hybrid form and often including governmental actors. Whilst the linkage to electoral politics is a central mechanism of legitimating governance activity, we note there are also other mechanisms including proceduralization and potentially also judicial accountability. But these public law forms do not exhaust the set of such mechanisms, and we consider also the contribution of private law forms and social and competitive structures which may support forms of legitimation. The central challenge identified concerns the possibility of reconceptualizing the global public sphere so as better to embrace TPR regimes in their myriad forms, so that they are recognized as having similar potential for legitimacy as national and international governmental bodies and regulation.},

The second approach provides a theoretical framework for sociolegal study of the transnational processes through which legal norms are constructed, flow, and settle across national borders.

Fourth, we introduce four empirical studies of transnational legal processes' differential effects in five regulatory areas in Asia, Africa, and South America that illustrate these points.

A further, insufficiently recognized, source of difficulty concerning the seabed mining regime has been the ambiguous status of the customary law of seabed mining. According to the developed states, seabed mining is within the scope of customary high seas freedoms, while for some developing states seabed exploitation is a recent technological innovation not encompassed by the traditional high seas regime. This paper argues that these differences of legal opinion have led the parties to employ diverse negotiating strategies, and have generated contrasting perceptions of the consequences of the failure to conclude a conventional seabed mining regime. Furthermore, the legal disagreements among the parties reveal that the consensually based, traditional process of forming customary law is under considerable stress, a development that has adverse consequences for the international legal order.},

  abstract = {The article analyses the concept of efficiency of law, including different aspects of efficiency, methods and preconditions to ensure efficient legislation. The difference is shown between efficiency of law and effectiveness of law - concepts that are usually mixed up in legal theory and sociology of law. Efficiency of law shows the degree of the results achieved through law, while effectiveness shows these results in relation to the input needed to achieve them. The article also explores the relation between efficiency and legitimacy of law. The conclusion is drawn that efficiency is not and ought not to serve as a ultimate criterion of legitimacy, but as a matter of fact plays very important role in determining whether a set of rules may be called law. The article also shows problems, which may have negative effects on the efficiency of law. These problems contrary to the popular belief are related mostly not to the realization of existing legal rules, but with the formation of these rules. In order to ensure efficiency of law the most important task is to evaluate both proposed rules and the manner in how these rules are brought to legislation. The conclusion is drawn that the system of legislation in Lithuania is equipped with basic necessary tools to evaluate efficiency of draft legislation, but attention has to be focused on further development and implementation of these methods. The focus of these efforts shall be the evaluation of the consequences of proposed draft rules, not the legislation procedures and techniques of law drafting.},

Yet, research on the privatization of security has almost completely focused only on the operative providers of private security: PMSCs. To understand private security, its advantages and dangers, however, one needs to arrive at a comprehensive view of private security. Beyond PMSCs, private businesses and their associations have established institutions playing a key role in the private provision of security. The question is approached by testing conditions derived from two streams of literature outside of the security realm: environmental governance and public goods theory. The testing is conducted by analyzing the activities of PMSCs and the shipping industry fighting Somali piracy. Here operational and regulative private initiatives can be found and conditions which favor or constrain the private provision of security assessed.},

@article{strattaCorrelationCytomegalovirusInfection1999a,
  abstract = {Relationships between viruses and autoimmune diseases such as systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) are still elusive. Recent reports demonstrated the association of some viral infections with peculiar clinical events in the general population, such as cytomegalovirus (CMV) with arterial damage and Parvovirus B19 (PV-B19) with hematologic abnormalities. We planned to look for this kind of viral imprinting in SLE, hypothesizing that traces of specific features of some viral infections might be found in some subsets of seropositive SLE patients. In 60 SLE patients recruited at our nephrologic center, serology for CMV, PV-B19, Epstein-Barr virus viral capsid antigen (EBV-VCA), Epstein-Barr nuclear antigen (EBNA) and Epstein-Barr virus early antigen (EBV-EA) was performed. chi2 and ANOVA were employed to compare the frequency and titers of antiviral antibodies in SLE patients with groups of transplant, hemodialysis and blood donor subjects. chi2, Fisher's test, Bonferroni and Scheffe's test were employed to compare the different biochemical/clinical features between seropositive and seronegative SLE patients. Univariate and multivariate analysis (logistic regression models) were employed to evaluate the odds ratio (OR) of different risk factors for vascular events (including Raynaud's phenomenon, deep venous thrombosis) and hematologic abnormalities (including severe anemia, leukopenia and thrombocytopenia). Anti-CMV (82\%), anti-PV-B19 (60\%), anti-EBV-VCA (92\%) and EBV-EA (45\%) IgG antibodies were frequent in SLE, with higher prevalence in comparison with the blood donor group and higher titers in comparison with transplant and hemodialysis groups. CMV seropositivity was a highly significant risk factor for Raynaud's phenomenon (OR +alpha in univariate and multivariate analysis = 13.51 using a correction of 0.5 in case of a zero event), but not for venous vascular events (OR = 1.31). An increased though not significant risk factor was found for antiphospholipid antibodies (OR = 2.71, p = 0.19), while the presence of nephrotic syndrome during the follow-up was a significant protective factor (OR = 0.15, p = 0.035). There was no significantly increased OR for PV-B19 seropositivity in cases with severe anemia (OR = 2.09, p = 0. 29). No significant associations were found with the status of EBV reactivation. In conclusion, our results support the hypothesis that viral infection may imprint the course of SLE leading to specific clinical subsets (i.e. CMV and 'vascular' SLE, with more frequent Raynaud's phenomenon and a less frequent typical histological renal picture responsible for nephrotic syndrome). Further prospective studies are justified to validate these correlations, mainly dealing with associations between acute viral infections and vascular events, thus eventually leading to a better understanding of mutual relationships between viruses and SLE.},

The development of their claims provides rich source material to compare and contrast the various geographical, historical, economic, and political factors which are responsible for their positions. Mexico's exclusive economic zone seems to be the product of a historical protectionist stance over petroleum and fishery resources of the coastal zone. Military factors and dreams of global greatness seem to be secondary or absent. On the other hand, Brazil's aggressiveness was manifested in the 1970s through a 200‐mile territorial sea claim stimulated by concern over national security as well as protection of natural resources. Regardless of the differences in the tones of their maritime claims, both countries have demonstrated independent law‐of‐the‐sea positions that could be expected from nationalist middle powers.},

@report{teubnerGlobalBukowinaLegal1996a,
  abstract = {There are a number of inchoate forms of global law, none of which are the creations of states. In relation to them I wish to develop three arguments:1. Global law can only be adequately explained by a theory of legal pluralism which turned from the law of colonial societies to the laws of diverse ethnic, cultural and religious communities in modern nation-states. It needs to make another turn - from groups to discourses. It should focus its attention on a new body of law that emerges from various globalization processes in multiple sectors of civil society independently of the laws of the nation states.2. The emerging global (not inter-national!) law is a legal order in its own right which should not be measured against the standards of national legal systems. It is not - as is usually understood - an underdeveloped body of law which has certain structural deficiencies in comparison to national law. Rather, its peculiar characteristics as fully fledged law distinguishes it from the traditional law of the nation states. These characteristics can be explained by differentiation within world society itself. While global law lacks political and institutional support on the global level, it is closely coupled with globalized socio-economic processes.3. Its relative distance from international politics will not protect global law from its re-politicization. On the contrary, the very reconstruction of social and economic (transactions as a global legal process undermines its non-political character and is the basis of its repoliticization. Yet this will occur in new and unexpected ways. We can expect global law to become politicized not via traditional political institutions but within the various processes under which law engages in 'structural coupling' with highly specialized discourses.},

  abstract = {This introductory article depicts the background scenario for the deployment of military Vessel Protection Detachments (VPDs) and Privately Contracted Armed Security Personnel (PCASP) on board commercial ships in transit off the coast of Somalia. The author highlights in detail a number of potential legal and non-legal issues raised by this kind of practice, focusing, in particular, on: a) the need to consider the use of VPDs and PCASP as a contingency measure; b) organizational problems such as logistics and questions of safety; c) conflicts of jurisdiction and issues of immunity (to be solved solely through the stipulation of bilateral agreements with coastal States); d) the possible arrest of pirates (as well as their further prosecution or release); and e) the “innocent passage” issue. The conclusion may seem slightly cynical as the author asserts that the less the protection service is regulated or even known to the public, the more effective it is in “problem-solving”. Indeed, with regard to private security companies, in order for their service to be profitable and financially sustainable, they must avoid the potential economic impact of criminal and civil proceedings on their business, as well as any other legal hurdle in general. In contrast, although military VPDs are normally characterized by a much greater level of transparency, the risk for them to be involved in a criminal investigation following any “incident” seems quite high, and this may affect the quality of their service.},

This is the so-called pirates' prison, a cream-coloured fortress, officially opened in November 2010 after a \$1.5m (pounds 950,000) refurbishment funded by the UN, to contain the pirates convicted of hijacking at sea off the Horn of Africa.},

  abstract = {What should we call law when it is not the law of one or several states? Does it actually matter what we call law? How can we take into account the consequences of calling something law when we shape the concept of law in the first place? How does international arbitration help to illustrate the problem? This book is an investigation into stateless law, illustrated by international arbitration regimes. It addresses key philosophical questions posed by international arbitration as a potential path to law beyond the state. It ascertains which dimensions of transnational legality arbitral regimes conform to, and what consequences follow from it. The argument of this book is firmly rooted in contemporary legal positivism and is attentive to current debates regarding the rule of law to ponder legality without territory. A theory is suggested regarding the minimal conditions that transnational regimes must fulfil in order to legitimately and appropriately count as law. The theory is tested on various arbitral regimes. The book thus offers reflections on the extent to which legality and the rule of law can serve as a moral and political benchmark for transnational regimes, to assess the political morality of arbitration's current autonomy from states and what arbitration's claim for an increase in that autonomy implies.},

These are said to be bound by the entire corpus of customary international rules. This presupposes, however, both that the analogy as such is sensible, and that the legal position of new States is correctly sketched. Both presumptions are open to doubts: surely, one cannot hold, without further thought, that an organization such as the UPU, established in the nineteenth century, is in the same position as a new State. And it is by no means generally accepted that all customary rules are binding on new States to begin with, however desirable such a position may be. For different elaborations of the argument},

Through the unanimous adoption of resolution 2077 (2012) under the Charter's Chapter VII, which followed a day-long debate on the issue (Press Release SC/10820 of 19 November), the Council also renewed its call upon States and regional organizations that had the capacity to do so to fight ongoing sea crimes by deploying naval vessels, arms and military aircraft and through seizures and disposition of boats, vessels, weapons used in the commission of those crimes.},

@article{vadiGlobalHealthGovernance2012,
  abstract = {According to the World Health Organization, tobacco consumption causes the death of five million people each year. Countries have increasingly adopted regulations aimed at diffusing public awareness and have massively adhered to the World Health Organization Framework Convention on Tobacco Control, which has established a cognitive and normative consensus for promoting global public health through tobacco control. Despite these successful approaches, the tobacco business has been facilitated by foreign investment protection, which has increased competition and lowered tobacco prices. By extensively protecting investor c rights to promote foreign direct investment and to foster economic development, international investment governance risks undermining the fundamental goals of tobacco control. This article investigates the relationship between international investment law and tobacco regulation. As investment agreements broadly define the notion of investment, tension exists when a State adopts tobacco control measures interfering with foreign investments, as regulation may he considered tantamount to expropriation under investment rules. In addition, investment treaties provide foreign investors' with direct access to investment arbitration. Thus, foreign investors can directly challenge national measures aimed at protecting public health and can seek compensation for the impact on their business of such regulation. As a result, the mere threat of an investor-state dispute may have a chilling effect on policy makers. Several questions arise in this context. Are investment treaties compatible with states' obligations to protect public health? Is investor-state arbitration a suitable forum to protect public interests? Are there am' limits to the power of states to enact public health regulations? In the light of parallel developments before other international law for a, this article critically assesses the clash between public health law and international investment law before investment treaty tribunals and offers a systematic and updated analysis of the recent cave law. The article then concludes with some policy options that may help policy makers and adjudicatory reconcile the different interests at stake. Adapted from source document.},

In examining this question, it is important to distinguish contract-based arbitration of individual claims against the State from arbitration pursuant to investment treaties. The former is broadly limited to the private sphere of the State's activity, whereas the latter gives arbitrators a comprehensive jurisdiction over public law. An elaboration of this distinction, and the grey area within it, demonstrates that the significance of international arbitration for juridical sovereignty is its privatization of the authority to define the very concept of the public sphere.},

This shift is captured by the triangle of marine governance, because the triangle refers to the institutional setting in which politics and policy making takes place (polity), to policy making itself (policy), to activities of politicians and processes of power (politics), and to the interplay between policy, politics and polity. Studying the dynamics of politics and policies in marine governance practices through the triangle allows us to analyze and explain how and why the shifts in locus and focus occur. These dynamics of marine governance—as the interplay of policy, politics and policy—is illustrated by the environmental governance of Dutch offshore platforms.},

Whereas earlier approaches would look at the sources as the singular moment of law-making, it is now generally understood that the broader process of speaking the language of international law contributes to its making. The contribution proceeds by sketching the move from sources to communicative practice against the backdrop of the 'linguistic turn', which proposes that law is made 'in action' (II.). It then dedicates sections to principal contemporary theories, starting off with the New Haven School as a pioneering approach to thinking of international law-making as a process of authoritative decision-making (III.). Its heritage is refined in the theory of transnational legal process (IV.). In contrast to these voices from New Haven, systems theory abstracts from the political strategies of concrete actors and is therefore in a good position to recognize law as an autonomous enterprise (V.). Practice theory then combines, first, sociological thought on the heels of Pierre Bourdieu and, second, philosophical insights of pragmatism (VI.). Governance theory then suggests paying more attention to regulatory networks as sites of law-making and to private actors whose normative output gains bite in the market place (VII.). The concluding outlook discusses the Global Administrative Law project and research centered on international public authority as responses to the normative challenges that come with the multiplication of forms and fora of international law-making (VIII.).},

Globalization, while integrating world economies, societies and cultures has also blurred the lines of responsibility for environmental damages incurred along the way. The maritime industry has long been hiding behind the fact that it is the least polluting mode of international transportation, and in comparison with alternatives such as truck, rail or air transport, it is. However in today’s increasingly environmentally conscious society where international regulations are also becoming ever stricter, many ship owners are waking up to a new dawn, and shipping players everywhere are noticing theirs is no longer a sufficient strategy.
There are three clear strategies for players in the shipping industry to take, they are outlined as
follows:
• One strategy shows players trying to avoid compliance who then often end up paying costly regulatory charges;
• Another strategy is basic compliance but only with
the minimum requirements;
• The third strategy is to go above and beyond both existing and expected laws and requirements. This thesis is concerned with determining whether or not pursuing the third strategy with regards to the environment, will result in a competitive advantage},

In a world context where trade and social concerns overlap in many ways, strategies based on international human rights law may disturb conceptions of the trade regime as narrowly directed towards trade facilitation, while also providing a basis to address difficult problems such as reconciling the concerns for high social standards in both the South and the North. The article describes and relates strategies based on international social rights at three potential venues for the development of the trade regime. First, a strategy of 'countering' could utilize international social rights law to guide interpretation and application of trade treaties, including to challenge the selective spread of such 'human' rights intellectual property rights and investment rights. Second, international social rights might be achieved by, and in turn guide, NGO 'branding' practices. Third, a strategy of 'dealing' informed by norms of international social rights could generate broader reforms to the trade regime that would address both concerns about fair trade and regulatory competition in developed countries and concerns about trade access and development in developing countries.},

Pragmatically considers the ideals and limitations of legal theory with regards to plural norms. Looks at the business norms found throughout the world with respect to similarities and differences. By using systems theory, is able to understand the actions and raison d'etre of transnational private law as it includes plural aspects of the normative orders to be found globally, particularly in nonstate social systems. Also extrapolates the multi-faceted nature of normative international business and its practices. Within business norms, the ideas of Santos may provide an improved paradigm of global legal pluralism, as with his thoughts on human rights and migration law. However, there are always expectations, which are expected by both legal practitioners and business interests, such as both state and nonstate norms and legal processes. Part of this functionality entices affective relationships meant to smooth such processes. The state too, must be a participant in normative conflict in plural orders. Also looks at how private law and private international law converge. S. Fullmer},

  abstract = {Globalization is sometimes considered to have led to the liftoff of international business transactions from national regulatory oversight. This Article is concerned with the connection between a liftoff of transnational business processes and the laws related to international economic transactions. In particular, the Article examines the "governing" role that national private laws play in transnational business relations through an examination of the regulatory function of private international law.The Article describes how recent "internationalist" reforms in private international law contribute to a possible liftoff and discusses representative policy justifications for these reforms, such as the facilitation of international commerce, the attainment of interstate cooperation, and the promotion of cosmopolitan fairness to parties. It then explores reasons why the traditional regulatory function of private international law has been obscured in recent internationalist reform, in particular by its ready, if misleading, identification with parochialism. To address such concerns, the Article describes a cosmopolitan account of the regulatory function of private international law in the contemporary era of globalization. It identifies the nature of the regulatory challenges that face private international law in the current international system and makes proposals for the kinds of regulatory role that private international law could play in the constitution of a pluralistic system of governance that might address some of the excesses of economic globalization.},

@article{waiTransnationalPrivateLaw2005,
  abstract = {This Article explores a social vision of global public order taken from trans-
national private law. It recasts the pote
ntial role of private law in the cross-
border  economic  context  as  centrally  co
ncerned  with  private  action  as  both
the object  and vehicle of substantive and procedural  governance.  Viewed in
this way, private law is a venue for th
e contestation and regulation of private
action by private action in the contempo
rary global system. With its distinctive
strengths and weaknesses, transnational pr
ivate law is viewed as one alterna-
tive  among  many  regimes  of  global  order  and  is  understood  to  perform  a  so-
cial—indeed, “public”—function in the embedding of private behavior and
relationships within a broader social order.
This  Article  identiªes  the  function
of  transnational  private  law  as  not
simply facilitation of transactions, but also compensation for harms and so-
cial regulation of transnational conduct. Further, it argues that transnational
private  law  can  serve  an  ideational  function  in  generating  communicative
interventions into the sometimes normatively closed national and functional
systems  of  contemporary  society.  In  serving  these  regulatory  and  ideational
functions, transnational private law offers a different vision of global public
order in which the task for state law is
not command and control to eliminate
conºict either within  or  across  systems, but rather  governance within and between social systems, including through allowing and sometimes facilitating conflict and contestation. It is with this distinctive vision that this Article begins.},

@article{wambuaJurisdictionalChallengesProsecution2012,
  abstract = {Since 2008 Kenya has distinguished itself in the global war against piracy by undertaking prosecutions in the national courts of suspected pirates arrested in the high seas and handed over by navies of leading maritime nations under bilateral agreements (MOUs) entered into between Kenya and these leading maritime nations. As of July 2011, Kenya had over 20 convicted pirates serving jail terms ranging between 7 and 20 years and over 100 suspected pirates awaiting trial in national courts. This is the largest number of suspected pirates held and tried in any one state at any given time in modern history. To achieve this, Kenya had to effect far reaching changes in the law. In the initial stages, suspected pirates were charged under Kenya’s Penal Code (Cap 63 Laws of Kenya). However, the high court in the case of Re Mohamud Mohamed Dashi and eight others [2010] eKLR, ruled that Kenya had no jurisdiction to try suspected pirates under that law. In September 2009, Kenya passed a new law (the Merchant Shipping Act), which not only defined more comprehensively and extensively the offence of piracy, but also extended the jurisdiction of Kenyan courts to try piracy committed by non-nationals. Though the law gives Kenya a very broad jurisdiction to try suspected pirates, the process is still fraught with challenges due to lack of financial and human resources. In the case of Republic vs Hassan Jama Haleys Alias Hassan Jamal and five others [2010] eKLR, the court commented thus: “… I must note that the ‘piracy trials’ have presented a unique challenge to the Kenyan legal system. We cannot ignore the fact that these are suspects who having been arrested by foreign naval forces on the High Seas are brought to Kenya for trial. They are strangers in the country, do not understand the legal system, may not know what their rights are and do not understand the language… the Kenyan Government and the International partners supporting these trials put in place a system to provide free legal representation for the suspects…” This paper discusses Kenya’s new model legislation and argues that while the model faces challenges, it should be replicated by all member states of International Maritime Organization as it not only grants extra territorial jurisdiction to national courts but also domesticates comprehensively the relevant key provisions in the fight against piracy found in the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS), the Convention on the Suppression of Unlawful Acts against Maritime Navigation (the SUA Convention), the International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea 1974 (the SOLAS Convention 1974), Code of Conduct Concerning the Repression of Piracy and Armed Robbery against Ships in the Western Indian Ocean and the Gulf of Aden (The Djibouti Code of Conduct), and the International Ship and Port Security Code (the ISPS Code). “In the 21st century more than ever before, no state can stand wholly alone. Collective strategies, collective institutions and a sense of collective responsibility are indispensable. The case of collective security today rests on three basic pillars. Today’s threats recognize no national boundaries are connected, and must be addressed at the global and regional as well as national levels” (UN 2005, A More Secure World: Our Shared Responsibility—Report of the United Nations Secretary General High Level Panel on Threats, Challenges and Change.

Indeed, conflicting norms and social systems are now at the centre-stage of jurisprudence. Conversely however, private international legal thinking can benefit from attention to the other legal disciplines that have preceded it in ‘going global’. It needs to undergo a conceptual overhauling in order to capture law’s novel foundations and features and adjust its epistemological and methodological tools to its transformed environment. It must reconsider the debate about legitimacy of political authority and the values that constitute its normative horizon. From this perspective, societal constitutionalism, as mooted by Teubner, provides a particularly promising avenue for unbounding the conflict of laws, which might then emerge as a form of de-centred, reflexive coordination of global legal interactions.},

The chapter recognizes these concerns, which are usually expressed in terms of a wide-ranging legitimacy deficit of private governance regimes. At the same time, I contend that there is no easy fix in response to regulatory developments that have their origin in nation-state transformation and in a functionally differentiated proliferation of global societal activity. I provide a brief account of what is here called the ‘Global Governance condition’ and of the particular challenges emanating therefrom for the development of legal agency. I then engage with law’s potential to resituate itself in a global context against the background of competing accounts of functionalism and normativism. Thereafter follows a discussion of the particular role played by private law in navigating public and private interests and of the (futile?) aspirations for a political critique. The next section contextualizes the public-private law dynamics against the background of a high degree of functional and sectorial specialization which characterizes transnationalization processes and significantly challenges any effort of designing overarching and inclusive models or concepts of post-national justice. The concluding section interrogates the prospects of an interdisciplinary and normative engagement with the pressing political regulatory challenges that arise from law’s transnationalization.},

In part III, I argue that an exemplary area such as corporate governance can best be understood as an instance of transnational legal pluralism, a field that becomes visible through a particular methodological lens.

  abstract = {The book under review addresses the complex interaction of hard and soft law, legal-political intervention and social practice and self-regulation, public and private law, and rules of social praxis and behaviour in transnational law. While the increased contractualization of public governance and the growing involvement of private actors in public administration has, for some time now, been the subject of legal analysis in domestic contract law and administrative law scholarship, these findings have attracted little attention from commercial and international law scholars and practitioners. Cutler’s book argues for the need to embrace a more comprehensive view of the complexity of developments in national, international and transnational law, acknowledging the emergence of new norm-generating actors and the challenge posed by them and their norms to the otherwise neatly defined realms of national and international legal orders. Exploring the arguments made against and in favour of lex mercatoria, Cutler can be read as arguing for the paradoxical re-entry of the dividing lines between state and civil society, public and private, even if and because the two opposing poles cannot be married in a single unifying concept but only together constitute the poles of our orientation.},

@report{zumbansenTransnationalPrivateRegulatory2012,
  abstract = {The continuing proliferation of transnational private regulatory governance challenges conceptions of legal authority, legitimacy and public regulation of economic activity. The transnational law merchant or, lex mercatoria, is a case in point in this context, as it represents a laboratory for the exploration of “private” contractual governance in a context, in which the assertion of public or private authority has itself become contentious. The ambiguity surrounding many forms of today’s contractual governance in the transnational arena echoes that of the far-reaching transformation of public regulatory governance, which has been characteristic of Western welfare states over the last few decades. What is particularly remarkable, however, is the way in which the depictions of “private instruments” and “public interests” in the post-welfare state regulatory environment have given rise to a rise in importance of social norms, self-regulation and a general anti-state affect in the assessment of judicial enforcement or administration of contractual arrangements. The paper suggests the need to short-circuit and to read in parallel the justifications offered for a contractual governance model, which prioritizes and seeks to insulate “private” arrangements from their embeddedness in regulated market contexts, on both the national and transnational level.},
