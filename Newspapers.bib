I am not convinced anyone has yet worked out a gold - plated solution for West Africa.” Until the Economic Community Of West A frican States agrees a formal policy, security firms operating in the region must stick to a purely advisory role. “They are on board but they have no arms,” Mr Roscoe said." LLOYD’S LIST, 2 April 2013, p 2 UK government holds fire on floating armouries - By Liz McMahon "The UK government will continue to consider floating armouries on a case - by - case basis, but has yet to issue a trade licence to authorise their use. A UK Foreign and Commonwealth Office spokesman told Lloyd’s List: “We do not export equip ment where there is a clear risk it might be used for internal repression or where it might be diverted to a different end - use or user.” The UK considers all export licences individually against these criteria, to reflect the prevailing circumstances and s tated end - use, both for armouries operated on water and for those on land."
